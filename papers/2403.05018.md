# [InstructGIE: Towards Generalizable Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05018)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent image editing methods using diffusion models have shown impressive results, but their generalization capability remains limited. They struggle to generate satisfactory edits when instructions are not explicitly included in the training data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes InstructGIE, a new image editing framework to enhance generalization robustness. It incorporates techniques to boost in-context learning and unify language instructions.

- To improve visual in-context learning, a VMamba-based module is added to better capture editing contexts from input image prompts. An editing-shift matching strategy is also proposed to guide the model's understanding of how editing should be done. 

- For language instructions, a unification technique is introduced. It aligns embeddings during training and inference to maximize consistency in output quality across varied language prompts.

- A selective area matching method focuses on preserving detail quality in important regions like human faces. It identifies these areas and optimizes to reduce distortion.

- A new dataset for image editing is collected with diverse visual prompt examples and editing instructions to facilitate in-context learning.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes multiple innovations in architecture and training strategies tailored to improve generalization for image editing tasks.
- Achieves superior quality and consistency in in-context generation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. 
- Demonstrates strong generalization capability to unseen editing instructions in extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments.
- Compiles and releases the first image editing dataset with comprehensive visual prompting annotations to advance research.
