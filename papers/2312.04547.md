# [Digital Life Project: Autonomous 3D Characters with Social Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04547)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points in this paper:

This paper presents Digital Life Project (DLP), an innovative framework to create autonomous 3D virtual characters with social intelligence and articulated body movement capabilities. DLP consists of two main components - SocioMind, the "digital brain" that models personalities and social relationships using psychological principles to enable natural dialogue and behavior, and MoMat-MoGen, the "digital body" that combines motion matching for quality and motion generation for diversity to synthesize contextually relevant character motions. Through SocioMind's few-shot persona modeling, memory reflection, and topic planning, characters can conduct both short-term interactive communication and exhibit long-term social evolution. Experiments demonstrate DLP's state-of-the-art performance, with metrics indicating strong alignment between behaviors and psychological states, high motion quality and diversity, and controllability of interactions. Visualizations further reveal the framework's ability to simulate evolving social relationships and responsively interact with human players. In summary, DLP makes significant strides towards replicating human social intelligence in virtual characters to simulate digital life.
