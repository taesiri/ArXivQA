# [End-to-End Learning for Fair Multiobjective Optimization Under   Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07772)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Many decision-making processes can be modeled as optimization problems with uncertain parameters that must be estimated from data. The paper focuses on an important class of such problems where the objective is to fairly optimize multiple competing objectives represented as an Ordered Weighted Average (OWA). Learning to optimize OWA objectives under uncertainty is challenging because OWA functions are non-differentiable, preventing end-to-end training of predictive models via backpropagation.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes techniques to enable end-to-end learning of fair multi-objective optimization problems with OWA objectives. The key ideas are:

1) Smooth approximations of OWA optimization problems to make them differentiable. Two techniques are proposed: 
  - Quadratization of an equivalent OWA LP problem
  - Replacing the OWA objective by its Moreau envelope  

2) Exploiting problem structure when the OWA coefficients are known and only part of the objective is uncertain. This allows blackbox differentiation without smoothing.

3) Using simpler surrogate optimization problems to produce candidate solutions when the OWA optimization is too complex. The OWA objective is still used as the loss function.

Contributions:

1) Novel techniques to differentiate OWA optimization problems to incorporate them into end-to-end learned prediction pipelines.

2) First application of Moreau envelope smoothing for approximation in end-to-end learning.

3) Modeling strategies combining prediction and OWA optimization tailored to problem structure.

4) Case studies demonstrating the promise of proposed techniques in emerging applications like robust portfolio optimization, multi-species routing, and fair learning-to-rank.

The techniques enable, for the first time, end-to-end learning for fair multi-objective optimization problems with non-differentiable OWA objectives.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes novel techniques to enable end-to-end learning of prediction models together with fair multiobjective optimization problems, by approximating nondifferentiable Ordered Weighted Averaging objectives to enable backpropagation through their constrained optimizations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is proposing novel techniques for differentiating OWA (Ordered Weighted Averaging) optimization models with respect to their uncertain parameters, allowing their integration in end-to-end trainable machine learning models. Specifically, it proposes differentiable approximations of OWA optimization problems to enable gradient-based learning, as well as techniques to leverage problem structure when the OWA objectives are known or when surrogate optimization models can be employed. Through these methods, the paper shows how optimization of OWA functions can be effectively integrated with parametric prediction for fair and robust optimization under uncertainty.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Predict-Then-Optimize (PtO): A framework for modeling decision-making processes with optimization problems that have unspecified parameters that must be estimated from data.

- Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA): A method of aggregating multiple objective criteria in a way that ensures fairness and robustness. 

- Fairness: Optimizing multiple competing objectives in an equitable way.

- Robustness: Ensuring the optimization solution performs well across different scenarios. 

- End-to-end learning: Training a machine learning model to directly maximize the performance of the downstream optimization problem. Requires differentiating through the optimization.

- Differentiable optimization: Developing continuous approximations of nondifferentiable optimization problems to enable gradient-based end-to-end learning.

- Decision quality: A loss function for end-to-end learning equal to the downstream optimization objective value.

- Moreau envelope: A smoothing technique that approximates nondifferentiable functions with differentiable ones.

- Surrogate optimization: Simpler, differentiable optimization problems used in place of intractable ones during end-to-end training.

The key focus areas are end-to-end learning for fair multiobjective optimization problems using OWA objectives. The paper develops techniques to overcome nondifferentiability.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using Moreau envelope smoothing to create a differentiable approximation of the OWA optimization problem. Can you explain in more detail how the Moreau envelope is constructed for the OWA function and why it creates a smooth approximation while maintaining the same optima?

2. One of the main challenges addressed in the paper is the non-differentiability of the OWA function, which prevents backpropagation when integrated into a machine learning model. Apart from Moreau envelope smoothing, what are some other potential ways the OWA optimization problem could be smoothed to enable end-to-end learning?

3. The paper leverages subgradients of the OWA function for backpropagation. However, subgradients are not unique. How does the choice of subgradient impact the performance of the end-to-end learning process? Are there any heuristic rules proposed in the paper for selecting "good" subgradients?  

4. The proposed method uses a projected gradient descent solver together with implicit differentiation to compute gradients of the smoothed OWA optimization problem. What are some potential disadvantages or stability issues with this approach compared to a more direct method?

5. For the case with a nonparametric OWA term, the paper proposes using the SPO+ scheme to enable end-to-end learning without smoothing the optimization problem. Can you explain in more detail how the regret bound from SPO+ is leveraged to derive a subgradient formula amenable to backpropagation?

6. The experimental section compares multiple approaches for end-to-end learning with OWA optimization, including quadratic smoothing of an LP formulation and Moreau envelope smoothing. What seems to be the main practical advantage of the Moreau envelope approach over quadratic smoothing based on the experimental results?

7. The paper states that OWA integer programs are intractable and proposes using a linear surrogate model instead. Can you propose an alternative approach to enable end-to-end learning with an OWA integer program without the use of a surrogate?

8. How does the choice of the OWA weight vector impact what types of fair solutions are obtained? Could the weight vector be learned in an end-to-end fashion as well? What challenges would this introduce?

9. The fair learning-to-rank application uses the Frank-Wolfe algorithm both during training and inference. Why is Frank-Wolfe preferred over a projection-based gradient method for this problem? What complications arise from using different solvers for training versus inference?

10. The paper focuses on integration of OWA optimization with predictive modeling. However, other ML workflows could also benefit from fair multiobjective optimization. Can you propose a different application area, apart from portfolio optimization or ranking, where the methods developed in this paper could be applied? What would need to be adapted?
