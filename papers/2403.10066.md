# [Contrastive Pre-Training with Multi-View Fusion for No-Reference Point   Cloud Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10066)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- No-reference point cloud quality assessment (NR-PCQA) aims to evaluate the perceptual quality of distorted point clouds without access to pristine references. 
- Learning-based NR-PCQA methods suffer from scarcity of labeled training data and thus generalize poorly across datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel contrastive pre-training framework tailored for PCQA (CoPA) to enable the model to learn quality-aware representations from unlabeled data. 
- Generate anchors by randomly mixing local patches of projected images from point clouds with different distortions to preserve quality information.
- Design positive and negative samples considering both content consistency and distortion correlation to facilitate learning representations attentive to high-level content features and low-level distortion patterns.  
- In model fine-tuning, propose a semantic-guided multi-view fusion module to effectively integrate quality-aware features from different rendering viewpoints using cross-attention.

Main Contributions:
- Propose CoPA, the first contrastive learning framework tailored for PCQA, to address label scarcity and improve generalization ability.  
- Carefully design anchor generation and sample selection strategies suited for quality assessment.
- A new semantic-guided multi-view fusion module for integrating features from different projections.  
- Extensive experiments show superior performance over state-of-the-art NR-PCQA methods on three benchmarks and strong generalization ability. Further experiments also demonstrate the integration of CoPA can benefit existing projection-based NR-PCQA models.
