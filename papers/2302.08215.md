# Aligning Language Models with Preferences through f-divergence   Minimization

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- It introduces a new framework called $f$-DPG for aligning language models with human preferences. The key idea is to approximate a target distribution representing the desired behavior by minimizing a divergence from the $f$-divergence family.- $f$-DPG generalizes existing methods like DPG (used in GDC) and RL with KL penalties (used in RLHF). By allowing any $f$-divergence objective, it provides a lot more flexibility. - The paper investigates the impact of using different $f$-divergence objectives to approximate the same target distribution. The central hypothesis seems to be that the choice of divergence measure significantly impacts the properties of the resulting model.- Through experiments on various alignment tasks, the paper shows that no single divergence is universally best. But some like JS divergence often strike a good balance between alignment and diversity. - The paper highlights that JS divergence frequently outperforms the commonly used forward KL divergence, leading to improved results over prior work like GDC. The benefits persist even as model size increases.In summary, the central focus is on investigating the impact of the divergence objective in approximating a target distribution for LM alignment. The key finding is that the choice of divergence makes a big difference, and objectives like JS often work much better than forward KL.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a new framework, f-DPG, for aligning language models with human preferences. Specifically:- f-DPG allows approximating any given target distribution by minimizing any f-divergence from the model distribution to the target. This unifies prior approaches like DPG (which uses forward KL) and RL with KL penalties (reverse KL). - The paper introduces a general formula for stochastic gradient descent with any f-divergence objective (Theorem 1). This allows exploring objectives beyond forward and reverse KL.- Through experiments on a diverse set of alignment tasks, the paper shows that the choice of f-divergence significantly impacts alignment quality and diversity of the resulting model. No single divergence is universally best.- The Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence is found to often strike a good balance between alignment and diversity objectives. JS-DPG frequently outperforms forward KL-DPG by a wide margin, leading to improved alignment over prior work.- The distinguishing characteristics of divergences are shown to persist even with increasing model size, highlighting the importance of selecting an appropriate divergence objective rather than just scaling up model size.In summary, the key contribution is a unified f-DPG framework for LM alignment that demonstrates both theoretically and empirically the significant impact of the choice of divergence measure on the resulting aligned model. Carefully selecting the divergence is crucial for optimization.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new framework called $f$-DPG for fine-tuning language models to approximate any given target distribution representing human preferences, by minimizing any f-divergence objective.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on aligning language models with human preferences compares and contributes to prior work:- It introduces a new framework called $f$-DPG that unifies and generalizes previous approaches like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Generative Distributional Control (GDC). $f$-DPG allows approximating any target distribution by minimizing any $f$-divergence, enabling exploration of different optimization objectives.- The paper investigates approximating various target distributions representing alignment goals like imposing lexical constraints, reducing social bias, enforcing factual consistency, etc. It focuses on four $f$-divergence objectives - forward KL, reverse KL, total variation, and Jensen-Shannon. - It demonstrates that there is no single best optimization objective, but that Jensen-Shannon divergence frequently strikes a good balance between alignment and diversity. This differs from prior work like GDC that focused only on forward KL.- The results show that minimizing well-chosen $f$-divergences leads to significant gains over previous methods like DPG and KL penalties. The distinguishing characteristics persist even as model size increases, highlighting the importance of divergence choice.- Compared to RLHF that leaves the target distribution implicit, this work defines it explicitly as an EBM. Compared to GDC that uses only forward KL, it explores a diverse set of $f$-divergences. The unified $f$-DPG framework is a key contribution.- The paper provides formal guarantees for $f$-DPG, like the gradient formula. It also analyzes the impact of different pseudo-rewards induced by various divergences on practical performance.In summary, this work integrates ideas from prior methods, proposes a more general framework, conducts an extensive empirical investigation, and provides insights into the effect of divergence objectives, advancing the state-of-the-art in LM alignment.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The paper suggests several potential directions for future research:- Developing more efficient algorithms for f-DPG. The authors note that f-DPG relies on importance sampling estimates of divergences, which can have high variance and thus hurt sample efficiency. Developing lower variance gradient estimators could improve performance.- Exploring other f-divergences beyond the ones studied. The authors evaluated KL, reverse KL, total variation, and Jensen-Shannon, but there are many other f-divergences that could be promising for alignment. - Applying f-DPG to even larger language models. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of f-DPG on models up to 1.5B parameters, but studying scaling trends on models with 10B+ parameters would be interesting.- Extending f-DPG to continuous spaces like images, video, audio. The current work focuses on discrete text, but extending these ideas to other modalities could be impactful.- Developing adaptive schemes for trading off alignment vs model drift over training. The choice of f-divergence impacts this tradeoff, but automatically tuning this during training could be beneficial.- Combining f-DPG with other alignment approaches like prompting, fine-tuning, or steering during decoding. f-DPG directly trains the model, but could complement other techniques.- Developing theoretical understanding of f-DPG's properties and when certain f-divergences are most appropriate. The empirical results provide some intuition, but formal analysis could further elucidate this.In summary, the authors propose improving algorithms, expanding the divergences studied, scaling up, extending to new modalities, developing adaptive training schemes, combining with other methods, and theoretical analysis as interesting future work after this initial investigation of f-DPG.
