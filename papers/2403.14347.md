## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a survey on real-time implementable cooperative aerial manipulation systems using multirotor platforms. The key focus is on prototype systems that have been actually built and tested, as opposed to just simulations. 

The paper first provides background on aerial manipulation in general, categorizing systems by platform type (quadrotors, hexacopters etc.), type of manipulator arm, and level of autonomy. Key challenges are listed including stability, accurate control, perception, and safety. 

The main section then reviews cooperative aerial manipulation approaches, organizing them into categories:

- Cable-suspended systems: Multiple quadcopters connected via cables to transport loads. Various control schemes are discussed along with experiments, both indoors and outdoors. Challenges around oscillations, wind disturbances and perception are covered.  

- Multi-DOF arm systems: Quadcopters equipped with multi-joint robotic arms to cooperatively manipulate objects. Issues with coupled dynamics, force control, and real-time motion planning are summarized.

- Ground-air manipulation: Collaboration between aerial vehicles and ground robots to transport longer loads. MPC, impedance and other control schemes are outlined.

- Rigidly connected vehicles: Quadcopters rigidly grasping a load distribute control efforts. Limited maneuverability is a drawback. 

- Flexible load transport: Using multirotors to cooperatively carry flexible objects like cloth or beams. Vibration suppression is key.

The paper also reviews modeling approaches for cooperative manipulation, with Newton-Euler and Euler-Lagrange being most common. It further analyzes control techniques in detail, covering areas like formation control, impedance regulation, vision-based and adaptive schemes. 

In conclusion, the survey shows that while progress has been made with lab prototypes, fully robust and autonomous cooperative manipulation is still an open challenge. Key future directions identified are combined learning/model-based control, handling outdoors operation, independent on-board perception and planning, and ensuring safety. The paper serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers looking to advance multi-vehicle aerial manipulation.
