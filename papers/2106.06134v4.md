# [Is Homophily a Necessity for Graph Neural Networks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06134v4)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Is strong homophily a necessary assumption for graph neural networks (GNNs) like graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to achieve good performance on semi-supervised node classification tasks?The paper challenges the prevalent notion in prior literature that GNNs rely on homophily and fail to generalize to heterophilous graphs. Through empirical observations and theoretical analysis, the authors aim to show that heterophily is not sufficient for poor GCN performance, and GCNs can achieve strong performance on certain types of heterophilous graphs under suitable conditions.In particular, the key hypotheses/claims appear to be:- GCNs can achieve good performance on some heterophilous graphs, counter to popular belief. - GCNs can learn similar embeddings for nodes with the same label if they share similar neighborhood patterns, regardless of homophily/heterophily.- There exist "good" and "bad" heterophily settings - GCNs can work well under the former but not the latter.So in summary, the central research question is re-examining the notion that homophily is required for good GNN/GCN performance, and showing that it is not strictly true under certain conditions. The key hypotheses focus on characterizing when GCNs can succeed on heterophilous graphs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Empirically finding that standard graph convolutional networks (GCNs) can achieve better performance than some carefully designed methods on certain heterophilous graph benchmark datasets. This challenges the prevalent notion that GNNs like GCNs fail on heterophilous graphs due to an inductive bias requiring homophily.- Providing theoretical analysis to show that GCNs can learn similar embeddings for nodes with the same label if those nodes share similar neighborhood patterns, even in heterophilous graphs. This helps explain when and why GCNs may succeed or fail on heterophilous graphs.- Characterizing different types of "good" vs "bad" heterophily based on whether same-label nodes have similar or dissimilar neighborhood patterns. GCNs can work well under "good" heterophily.- Examining common benchmark graphs to reconcile GCN performance based on whether they exhibit properties amenable to GCN learning, like distinct neighborhood patterns for nodes of the same class.In summary, the key contributions are showing both empirically and theoretically that homophily is not strictly necessary for GCNs, and carefully characterizing the conditions under which GCNs can achieve strong performance on heterophilous graphs. This provides a new perspective on GCN inductive biases and their suitability for heterophily.
