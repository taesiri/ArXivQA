 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces MotionCtrl, a unified and flexible motion controller for video generation that can effectively and independently control both camera motion and object motion in generated videos. The model comprises two modules - the Camera Motion Control Module (CMCM) and the Object Motion Control Module (OMCM). The CMCM cooperates with the temporal transformers in the video generation model to guide global camera motion using a sequence of camera poses. The OMCM incorporates with the convolutional layers to indicate object positions using trajectories. A multi-step training strategy is employed to address the lack of a dataset with comprehensive motion annotations. Experiments demonstrate MotionCtrl's superior capability over state-of-the-art methods in precise and adjustable control of diverse camera motions and object trajectories within the same framework. The motion conditions based on camera poses and trajectories minimally impact object appearances. Moreover, MotionCtrl exhibits strong generalizability to various motions once trained. In summary, MotionCtrl facilitates more fine-grained and flexible motion control in video generation.
