# [Gaussian Process-Based Learning Control of Underactuated Balance Robots   with an External and Internal Convertible Modeling Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10155)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper considers control of underactuated balance robots which have fewer control inputs than degrees of freedom (DOFs). Controlling them requires simultaneous trajectory tracking of the actuated DOFs and balance control of the unactuated, unstable DOFs.

- The existing external and internal convertible (EIC) form-based control method can lead to uncontrolled robot motion under certain conditions. Specifically, if the rank condition on the inertia matrix is satisfied and all control inputs affect the unactuated subsystem, some DOF motions will be uncontrolled.

Proposed Solution: 
- Two learning control methods called partial EIC (PEIC) and null-space EIC (NEIC) are proposed to enhance EIC control using Gaussian process (GP) based data-driven robot dynamics models.

- PEIC control partitions the dynamics into a fully actuated subsystem and a reduced order unactuated subsystem to avoid uncontrolled motion. It assigns the balance task to only a subset of actuated DOFs.  

- NEIC control compensates the uncontrolled motion in a subspace while keeping other stable dynamics unchanged. It explicitly controls the uncontrolled DOF motions.

Main Contributions:

- Reveals uncontrolled motion property in EIC-based control of underactuated robots satisfying rank conditions.

- Proposes PEIC and NEIC control designs to eliminate uncontrolled motion by leveraging GP-based dynamics structure.

- Guarantees stability and bounded tracking errors without causing uncontrolled motion that exists in original EIC control.

- Validates the control performance and advantages over EIC and model-based control through experiments on a 2-DOF rotary inverted pendulum and a 3-DOF leg robot.
