# [Gaussian Process-Based Learning Control of Underactuated Balance Robots   with an External and Internal Convertible Modeling Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10155)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper considers control of underactuated balance robots which have fewer control inputs than degrees of freedom (DOFs). Controlling them requires simultaneous trajectory tracking of the actuated DOFs and balance control of the unactuated, unstable DOFs.

- The existing external and internal convertible (EIC) form-based control method can lead to uncontrolled robot motion under certain conditions. Specifically, if the rank condition on the inertia matrix is satisfied and all control inputs affect the unactuated subsystem, some DOF motions will be uncontrolled.

Proposed Solution: 
- Two learning control methods called partial EIC (PEIC) and null-space EIC (NEIC) are proposed to enhance EIC control using Gaussian process (GP) based data-driven robot dynamics models.

- PEIC control partitions the dynamics into a fully actuated subsystem and a reduced order unactuated subsystem to avoid uncontrolled motion. It assigns the balance task to only a subset of actuated DOFs.  

- NEIC control compensates the uncontrolled motion in a subspace while keeping other stable dynamics unchanged. It explicitly controls the uncontrolled DOF motions.

Main Contributions:

- Reveals uncontrolled motion property in EIC-based control of underactuated robots satisfying rank conditions.

- Proposes PEIC and NEIC control designs to eliminate uncontrolled motion by leveraging GP-based dynamics structure.

- Guarantees stability and bounded tracking errors without causing uncontrolled motion that exists in original EIC control.

- Validates the control performance and advantages over EIC and model-based control through experiments on a 2-DOF rotary inverted pendulum and a 3-DOF leg robot.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a Gaussian process-based learning control approach for underactuated balance robots that enhances the external and internal convertible form-based control to avoid uncontrolled motion and achieve guaranteed tracking and balancing performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new learning-based modeling and control framework for underactuated balance robots using Gaussian process (GP) models and taking advantage of the external and internal convertible (EIC) structure in the robot dynamics. Specifically, the paper:

1) Reveals underlying limitations of the EIC-based control, namely the potential for uncontrolled motion under certain conditions. 

2) Presents two new GP-based controllers called the partial EIC (PEIC) control and null-space EIC (NEIC) control that eliminate or compensate for the uncontrolled motion while preserving the EIC structure.

3) Provides stability analysis for the GP-enhanced PEIC and NEIC control designs, showing guaranteed convergence rates and error bounds.  

4) Validates the new control designs on two experimental underactuated balance robot platforms, demonstrating improved tracking and balancing performance compared to traditional EIC and model-based control.

In summary, the key contribution is integrating GP-based learning for dynamics modeling with the structured EIC control framework to achieve robust simultaneous trajectory tracking and balance control for underactuated robots. The proposed methods avoid limitations of the original EIC methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two enhanced controllers, PEIC and NEIC, to improve the performance of the original EIC controller. What are the key differences in how PEIC and NEIC controllers handle the uncontrolled motion issue compared to the original EIC controller?

2. The paper shows that the original EIC controller can lead to uncontrolled motion under certain conditions (Lemma 1). Can you explain intuitively why this uncontrolled motion happens and what specific conditions lead to it? 

3. How does the PEIC controller eliminate the uncontrolled motion by reshaping the coupling between actuated and unactuated subsystems? Explain the key idea.

4. For the NEIC controller, how does the added compensation term in the null space help to control the originally uncontrolled motion while keeping other motion unchanged? Explain the mechanism.

5. What is the rationale behind using a GP-based nominal model instead of an analytical model in the enhanced EIC controllers? What advantages does it provide?

6. The paper provides some model selection criteria (Conditions C1-C3) for choosing an appropriate nominal model. Can you explain the necessity of each condition intuitively?

7. How do you ensure that the closed-loop system under PEIC/NEIC control is stable by properly selecting control gains? Explain the stability analysis.  

8. For NEIC control, how does adjusting the gain Î± help to reduce tracking errors of the actuated coordinates? What is the trade-off?

9. What are the advantages of the PEIC controller over the NEIC controller in terms of tracking performance, as evidenced by the 3-DOF inverted pendulum experiments?

10. How does this method compare with other machine learning based control methods for underactuated robots, such as GP-based MPC? What are the pros and cons?
