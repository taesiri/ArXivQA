# [Social Reward: Evaluating and Enhancing Generative AI through   Million-User Feedback from an Online Creative Community](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09872)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Evaluating the performance of text-to-image generative AI models in the context of social network popularity and creative editing presents challenges. Existing automated metrics and human preference models have limitations in capturing community-level creative preferences.

Proposed Solution
- Introduce a new concept "Social Reward" which leverages implicit feedback from millions of social network users engaged in creative editing of AI-generated images.
- Curate a large-scale dataset called "Picsart Image-Social" with over 1 million image triplets showing community preferences.
- Develop a Social Reward model by fine-tuning CLIP that outperforms existing scoring models in predicting social popularity.
- Show Social Reward can be used to fine-tune text-to-image models to better align with creative community preferences.

Key Contributions
- Identify importance but unexplored dimension of modeling human preference towards social popularity for creative editing.
- Collect first million-scale dataset reflecting community creative preferences for AI-generated images.
- Propose Social Reward model superior at predicting social popularity compared to existing metrics.
- Demonstrate fine-tuning text-to-image models with Social Reward improves alignment with community creativity goals.

In summary, the paper introduces Social Reward to assess text-to-image models from the lens of social popularity for creative editing based on a large collected dataset. The proposed scoring model and fine-tuning approach aligns AI-generated images closer to community artistic preferences.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Social Reward, a new metric to evaluate and enhance text-to-image models by modeling implicit feedback from millions of social media users engaged in creative editing of AI-generated images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Identifying a new dimension for evaluating text-to-image models: assessing their ability to produce images that align with social popularity and creative editing preferences in online communities. The paper shows limitations of existing metrics in capturing this aspect.

2) Curation of a large-scale dataset called Picsart Image-Social with over 1 million images and implicit feedback signals based on remixing behaviors of users on the Picsart platform. This data reflects creative editing intent at community scale.

3) Development and validation of a Social Reward model trained on the Picsart Image-Social dataset that outperforms existing scoring models in estimating social popularity for image editing.

4) Demonstrating the potential of the Social Reward model for fine-tuning text-to-image models to better align with community preferences, as evidenced both quantitatively and qualitatively.

In summary, the key innovation is in identifying and modeling the dimension of social popularity for image editing through a community-scale dataset and tailored Social Reward model. This allows for better evaluation and improvement of text-to-image generative models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "Social Reward" for evaluating text-to-image models. How is this concept distinct from existing metrics and what specific limitations does it aim to address?

2. The Picsart Image-Social dataset relies on remix counts as a measure of image popularity. What are the advantages and potential limitations of using this metric compared to more conventional signals like views or likes? 

3. The data collection process applies several techniques to reduce biases like prompt bias, exposure time bias, etc. What other potential sources of bias should be considered and how can they be mitigated?

4. The prompt analysis reveals substantial differences between the Picsart dataset prompts compared to existing datasets like ImageReward and Pick-a-Pic. What implications does this have for the generalizability of models trained on those datasets?

5. The Social Reward model is trained using a triplet loss function. What is the intuition behind using triplet loss in this context and what alternatives were considered? How sensitive are the results to the choice of loss function?

6. While the Social Reward model outperforms others, the absolute accuracy is still far from perfect. What factors contribute to the remaining errors and how can the model be further improved? 

7. The fine-tuning experiments demonstrate improved alignment with social preference signals. However, CLIP alignment decreases slightly. Why might this occur and is it necessarily problematic?

8. Beyond quantitative metrics, what other ways can we validate that the Social Reward model better captures creative community preferences compared to existing solutions?

9. The concept of Social Reward provides a new perspective on evaluating and enhancing text-to-image models. What other applications, tasks or communities could benefit from a similar social popularity based approach? 

10. The use of implicit feedback signals has advantages but also risks compared to explicit annotation. How can this approach be combined with explicit annotation in a mutually beneficial way?
