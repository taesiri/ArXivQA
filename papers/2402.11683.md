# [One Prompt To Rule Them All: LLMs for Opinion Summary Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11683)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluation of opinion summaries using reference-based metrics has poor correlation with human judgments and fails to provide holistic assessment.
- Recent work has shown promise in using LLMs as reference-free metrics for NLG evaluation, but remains unexplored for opinion summarization. 
- Limited availability of opinion summary evaluation datasets is an impediment. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce SummEval-OP, an opinion summarization evaluation dataset with 2,912 summary annotations across 7 quality dimensions - fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness, aspect coverage, sentiment consistency and specificity.
- Propose Op-I-Prompt, a dimension-independent prompt, and Op-Prompts, dimension-specific prompts for evaluating opinion summaries using LLMs.
- Benchmark performance of recent LLMs on SummEval-OP for the 7 dimensions.

Key Contributions:
- Release of SummEval-OP dataset to facilitate progress in opinion summary evaluation.
- Demonstration that Op-I-Prompt outperforms prior approaches in correlating with human judgments, achieving average Spearman correlation of 0.70. It emerges as a good alternative for evaluating opinion summaries.  
- First investigation into applicability of different prompt strategies for utilizing both closed-source and open-source LLMs as opinion summary evaluators across 7 quality dimensions.

In summary, the paper introduces datasets, prompt strategies and benchmarks to advance opinion summarization evaluation using LLMs as an alternative to inadequate reference-based metrics. The Op-I-Prompt demonstrates promising capability as an automatic LLM-based evaluator for this domain.
