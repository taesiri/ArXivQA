# [Abstracting Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03789)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper "Abstracting Causal Models":

Problem:
- The paper considers the issue of abstracting detailed, low-level causal models into simpler high-level causal models. 

- Abstraction involves ignoring "inessential differences" between models but it is unclear what counts as an inessential difference.

- Rubenstein et al. (RW+) provided a definition of "exact transformation" between probabilistic causal models to capture when one model is an abstraction of another. 

- However, the RW+ definition allows models that seem significantly different to be related by an exact transformation, suggesting it is too broad of a definition.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper strengthens the RW+ definition by proposing a sequence of progressively more restrictive definitions:

1. Uniform transformation: applies to deterministic models, does not allow differences to be hidden by choice of probability distribution.

2. Abstraction: the mapping between interventions is determined by the state mapping, addresses some counterintuitive cases. 

3. Strong abstraction: takes into account all possible interventions in the models, not just "allowed" interventions.

4. Constructive abstraction: special case of 3, mapping from low-level states partitions variables and maps cells to unique high-level variables.

- Show that constructive abstraction includes procedures for grouping micro-variables into macro-variables and captures all RW+ examples.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies limitations in previous definitional work on abstraction of causal models.

- Provides more rigorous definitions that avoid counterintuitive cases of "abstraction".

- Constructive abstraction likely most useful in practice; gives intuition connecting micro- to macro-variables.

- Shows that common techniques for causal abstraction are instances of the proposed definitions.

- Lays groundwork for future work: approximate abstraction, actual causation across levels, relating levels for explainable AI.
