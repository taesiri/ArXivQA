## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating graphs with specific, user-defined properties is a crucial but challenging graph machine learning task. Existing graph generation methods like Erdős-Rényi and Barabási-Albert models fail to capture diverse graph properties simultaneously. Recent advances in graph neural networks can model complex patterns but require pre-compiling datasets with desired properties before training. There is a need for a practical graph generator that can produce varied graph types adhering to given properties without multiple separately trained models.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces the Neural Graph Generator (NGG), a novel conditional latent diffusion model for controlled graph generation. Key aspects:

- Uses a variational graph autoencoder to compress graphs into latent vectors capturing structural properties.  

- Performs diffusion in the latent space, adding Gaussian noise over timesteps. A neural network gradually denoises vectors.

- Conditions the denoising on vector summaries of graph statistics like node counts, density etc. guiding diffusion to match properties.

- Decoder transforms denoised vectors into generated graphs with desired traits.


Main Contributions:

- Proposes a new paradigm for graph generation via conditioned latent diffusions, sidestepping need for specialized datasets.

- Introduces a large-scale 1M graph dataset covering diverse synthetic graph families for pretraining.

- Achieves superior performance over baselines in capturing graph traits, generalizing to larger graphs, and handling missing conditioning values.

- Demonstrates qualitative validity by generating graphs adhering closely to given properties vectors.

- Releases pre-trained models and dataset to benefit the research community.

The NGG model signifies an important advance in flexible graph generation, able to produce varied graph types conditioned only on high-level statistical properties.
