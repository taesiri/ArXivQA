# [DBCopilot: Scaling Natural Language Querying to Massive Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03463)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces DBCopilot, a framework to scale natural language querying to massive databases. DBCopilot decouples the text-to-SQL process into two phases - schema routing and SQL generation. For schema routing, it uses a lightweight sequence-to-sequence neural network to identify the relevant databases and tables to answer a natural language question. To handle complex relationships between tables, it constructs a schema graph and uses depth-first search serialization and graph-based constrained decoding. To automatically adapt to new schemas, it generates synthetic training data by sampling schemas and asking reverse questions. For SQL generation, it explores prompt engineering strategies to incorporate candidate schemas into large language models. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate DBCopilot's effectiveness in schema routing and end-to-end text-to-SQL, significantly advancing the capability of handling text queries on large-scale databases. The key innovations are using a copilot model for scalable schema routing and exploring LLM-copilot collaboration for text-to-SQL.
