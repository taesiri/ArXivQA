# [How to guess a gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04709)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
Gradient-based optimization methods like backpropagation are the dominant paradigm for training neural networks. However, backpropagation has limitations around memory usage and parallelizability that prevent scaling to very large models. Alternative methods based on directional derivatives can avoid these issues but perform poorly due to the high-variance of the gradient estimates. This paper studies how to narrow this performance gap by better exploiting structure in the gradients.

Key Ideas:
- Show that gradients lie in a predictable, low-dimensional subspace dependent on the network architecture and features. This structure can be exploited to make better gradient guesses.

- Propose methods to guess gradients by using knowledge of network topology and activations:
   - Activation perturbation: Guess gradients in activation space rather than weight space
   - Activation mixing: Use random mixtures of activations as guesses
   - $W^T$: Transform random guess vector using weight matrix transpose 
   - Partial backpropagation: Backpropagate random guess vector through part of network

- Show these methods achieve 100-1000x higher cosine similarity to true gradient versus random guessing

- When used to train MLPs, these methods outperform random guessing but still underperform backpropagation, especially on more complex datasets

- Identify bias as a key limitation, analyze source of bias theoretically 

- Discover "self-sharpening" phenomenon where guess space narrows over training, improving guesses

- Demonstrate applications in parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large vision models

Main Contributions:
- Establish existence of exploitable structure in neural network gradients 
- Propose methods to exploit this structure and achieve state-of-the-art results among gradient-guessing techniques
- Provide analysis of limitations around bias and performance gaps to backpropagation
- Discover new phenomena like self-sharpening that suggest future research directions

Overall, the paper makes both theoretical and empirical contributions around understanding and better exploiting intrinsic structure in gradients to optimize neural networks more efficiently.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes methods to exploit the structure in neural network gradients to make better guesses of the gradients without computing losses or labels, demonstrating significantly higher cosine similarity than prior work, albeit with some limitations such as bias that need to be addressed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes several methods to improve gradient guessing for neural network optimization. The key ideas are:

1) Exploiting architecture constraints like sparsity and parameter sharing to narrow the guessing space and produce guesses with much higher cosine similarity to the true gradient compared to naive directional descent. 

2) Analyzing the relationship between activations and gradients, and using that to generate guesses in the same subspace as the gradients.

3) Studying the optimization properties and limitations (like bias) of these improved guesses, and showing they lead to significantly better optimization performance on MLPs and Mixer architectures compared to directional descent.

4) Demonstrating an unexpected "self-sharpening" phenomenon where guessing gets easier over training, allowing >95% CIFAR10 training accuracy without backpropagation.

5) Highlighting bias as a key limitation to scaling these methods to large models, analyzing its source, and showing that techniques like increasing downstream layers for guessing can increase bias.

In summary, the main contribution is providing both theoretical and empirical evidence that the gradient contains exploitable structure beyond naive guessing, leading to new techniques for narrowing the guessing space. The paper also studies the effects, optimization properties, limitations and surprising phenomena resulting from these improved guesses.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Gradient guessing - Using methods to estimate/guess gradients rather than directly computing them with backpropagation. This includes techniques like directional derivatives and activation perturbations.

- Architecture constraints - Using knowledge of the network architecture like weight matrices and activations to narrow the guessing space and produce better gradient guesses.

- Activation mixing - Guessing gradients by taking random mixtures of activations, which tend to lie in a similar subspace. 

- Bias vs variance tradeoff - Many of the proposed gradient guessing methods introduce bias to reduce the variance. Understanding this tradeoff is important.

- Self-sharpening - An phenomenon where the gradient guessing space narrows over the course of training, making guesses easier. But this can hurt generalization. 

- Cosine similarity - Measuring the angle between the guessed and true gradient. Higher is better.

- MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10/100 - Datasets used to benchmark the performance of the methods.

- Local losses - Auxiliary loss functions used to supervise gradient guesses.

So in summary, the key ideas have to do with estimating gradients by exploiting architectural constraints and activations, while managing the bias-variance tradeoff. The performance is analyzed on image datasets using metrics like cosine similarity.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes several methods for generating better gradient guesses by exploiting architecture and activation information, such as activation perturbation, activation mixing, $W^T$, and 1-layer downstream propagation. How do these methods differ in terms of bias versus variance trade-offs? What are the strengths and limitations of each?

2. The self-sharpening phenomenon is interesting but seems to lead to overfitting. What causes this phenomenon and why does it increase cosine similarity over time? How might the feedback loop between guess quality and weight matrix rank be avoided to prevent overfitting?  

3. The paper analyzes how bias arises in the proposed gradient guess estimators. How does the non-identity covariance matrix of the guesses lead to bias? Can methods from debiasing or variance reduction be applied to reduce this?

4. The results show improved optimization for 1 step, but there are still significant gaps in performance compared to backpropagation when training full models. Why do the methods fail to scale effectively? What factors might be most responsible for the performance gap?

5. The mixer architecture experiments show an intriguing result where the guessed gradient methods generalize better than backpropagation. What causes this? Is it specific to mixers or a more general phenomenon?

6. For the self-sharpening experiments, what causes the instability? How sensitive are the results to factors like choice of optimizer, learning rate, batch size, etc? Could methods like gradient clipping help?

7. The activation subspaces are shown to be surprisingly predictive of the gradient direction. Why might this be the case? Is there theory that could explain this alignment?

8. In what ways are the proposed methods complementary to existing work on loss-based gradient approximations? How feasible would it be to combine them? What benefits might that provide?

9. What implications do the results have for neuroscience and biologically plausible learning algorithms? Could the alignment of activations and gradients translate to insights for credit assignment in the brain?  

10. The paper mentions test-time adaptation as a potential area where guessed gradients could be impactful. What modifications would need to be made for online and continual learning settings? How might the bias and overfitting issues be addressed?
