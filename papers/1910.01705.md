# [Is Fast Adaptation All You Need?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01705)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is whether incorporating robustness to catastrophic interference in the meta-learning objective leads to representations that are more suitable for incremental learning, compared to just maximizing fast adaptation like MAML does. The key hypothesis is that directly minimizing interference during meta-training will result in representations that are more conducive for incremental learning than those learned through fast adaptation alone.In summary, the paper investigates if a meta-learning objective that incorporates robustness to catastrophic interference is better than simply maximizing fast adaptation for learning representations suitable for incremental learning. The main hypothesis is that directly minimizing interference is crucial.
