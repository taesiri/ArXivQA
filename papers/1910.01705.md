# [Is Fast Adaptation All You Need?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01705)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is whether incorporating robustness to catastrophic interference in the meta-learning objective leads to representations that are more suitable for incremental learning, compared to just maximizing fast adaptation like MAML does. The key hypothesis is that directly minimizing interference during meta-training will result in representations that are more conducive for incremental learning than those learned through fast adaptation alone.In summary, the paper investigates if a meta-learning objective that incorporates robustness to catastrophic interference is better than simply maximizing fast adaptation for learning representations suitable for incremental learning. The main hypothesis is that directly minimizing interference is crucial.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is investigating whether incorporating robustness to interference in the meta-learning objective improves performance on incremental learning benchmarks. Specifically, the paper compares two meta-learning objectives:1) MAML - Which maximizes fast adaptation and generalization.2) MRCL - Which additionally minimizes interference between updates. The authors find that representations learned by MRCL significantly outperform MAML on incremental learning benchmarks that require online learning from correlated streams of data. This suggests that minimizing interference is important for meta-learning representations suitable for incremental learning, and fast adaptation alone is not sufficient.The key novelty is empirically demonstrating the benefit of the MRCL objective over the popular MAML objective on incremental learning tasks. The paper also proposes a new continual learning prediction task setup for comparing meta-learning algorithms.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper compares meta-learning objectives for learning representations suitable for incremental learning, finding that directly minimizing interference between updates leads to representations more robust to catastrophic forgetting than just maximizing fast adaptation and generalization on few-shot tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several important contributions:1. It investigates a novel training signal for meta-learning - robustness to catastrophic interference - instead of just maximizing fast adaptation like most prior meta-learning methods. 2. It proposes a new meta-learning problem formulation - continual learning prediction (CLP) tasks - that requires both fast adaptation and robustness to interference. This allows direct comparison of different meta-learning objectives on their ability to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.3. The paper empirically demonstrates that directly minimizing interference during meta-training leads to representations that are more suitable for incremental learning compared to just maximizing fast adaptation. This challenges the common wisdom that fast adaptation alone is sufficient for meta-learning effective representations/initializations for continual learning.4. The results provide new insights into the importance of taking into account the effects of incremental learning during meta-training. They suggest that objectives like MRCL that incorporate online updates may be better than MAML-style objectives for continual learning.5. The paper makes useful connections between the meta-learning and incremental/continual learning literatures. It highlights that meta-learning approaches can be used to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, while incremental learning scenarios are useful testbeds for evaluating different meta-learning algorithms.In summary, this paper advances our understanding of how to meta-learn representations suitable for continual learning. The introduced formulation and experimental results strengthen the motivation for designing meta-learning objectives that explicitly optimize for reducing interference. It opens up new research directions at the intersection of meta-learning and incremental learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring other possible second-order metrics besides fast adaptation and generalization that could be used as training signals in meta-learning. For example, in this work they explored using robustness to catastrophic interference, but there may be other metrics worth investigating as well.- Comparing different meta-learning objectives and architectures on a wider range of continual/incremental learning benchmarks. This could provide more insight into what objective functions and model components are most effective for continual learning under different conditions.- Exploring the combination of meta-learning objectives like MRCL with other techniques like rehearsal or constraints that have proven effective for continual learning. The authors suggest the MRCL objective may be complementary to these other approaches. - Developing theoretical understandings of why the MRCL objective results in representations that are more robust to catastrophic interference. The authors provide some intuition, but formal theoretical analysis could further elucidate the differences between objectives.- Extending the ideas to continual reinforcement learning settings, which the authors note is an important direction for future work.In summary, the authors point to the need for more research on metrics beyond fast adaptation in meta-learning, more extensive empirical comparisons, combinations with other continual learning techniques, theoretical analysis, and application to continual RL as key areas for future work based on this paper.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper investigates whether incorporating robustness to interference in the meta-learning objective results in representations that are more suitable for incremental learning compared to just maximizing fast adaptation. The authors introduce a new meta-learning problem setting called Continual Learning Prediction (CLP) tasks which require both fast adaptation and robustness to interference. They compare two objectives for meta-learning representations on CLP tasks - MAML, which maximizes fast adaptation, and MRCL, which additionally minimizes interference. Using Omniglot datasets constructed into CLP tasks, they show that the representation learned by MRCL significantly outperforms MAML on incremental learning benchmarks at meta-test time. This demonstrates that directly minimizing interference leads to representations better suited for incremental learning compared to just maximizing adaptation, even though both objectives result in comparable generalization performance when trained and tested under the IID setting. The key difference is that MRCL takes into account the effects of catastrophic forgetting during meta-training.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper investigates whether incorporating robustness to catastrophic interference in the meta-learning objective improves performance on incremental learning tasks. The authors compare two meta-learning objectives - MAML, which maximizes fast adaptation on few-shot learning tasks, and MRCL, which additionally minimizes interference between updates on streaming data. They test the learned representations on Continual Learning Prediction (CLP) tasks, which require fast adaptation and robustness to interference. CLP tasks consist of predicting highly correlated streams of data in an online setting. The authors find that on CLP tasks, the representation learned by MRCL significantly outperforms MAML, indicating that directly minimizing interference results in representations more suitable for incremental learning. As a sanity check, they show MAML and MRCL perform equally well on IID batches, confirming the quality of the representations is comparable. This highlights the importance of the objective in meta-learning - simply maximizing fast adaptation is not sufficient for continual learning. Minimizing interference is critical for learning representations that mitigate catastrophic forgetting.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes learning representations that are robust to catastrophic interference for effective incremental learning. To compare different objectives for learning such representations, the authors introduce the Continual Learning Prediction (CLP) task. A CLP task consists of a sequence of highly correlated observations that the model must make predictions on in an online manner. To apply neural networks to CLP tasks, the authors meta-learn an encoder network which transforms the inputs into a vector representation. This encoder is treated as a meta-parameter and learned on CLP tasks sampled from a meta-training set. The paper compares two objectives for learning the encoder - (1) the MAML objective which maximizes adaptation and generalization on few shot learning tasks, and (2) the MRCL objective which additionally minimizes interference between updates on different parts of the trajectory. After meta-training the encoder, it is evaluated by using it to learn classifiers on new CLP tasks in an online manner. The results show that the encoder learned by MRCL significantly outperforms MAML, indicating that directly minimizing interference leads to representations more suitable for incremental learning compared to just maximizing adaptation and generalization.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the question of whether fast adaptation alone is sufficient for learning representations that are effective for incremental learning, or if directly incorporating robustness to catastrophic interference into the meta-learning objective leads to better performance. The key points are:- Gradient-based meta-learning methods like MAML are very effective for few-shot learning. They achieve this by using fast adaptation and generalization on a meta-training set as training signals.- However, little attention has been given to other possible training signals beyond fast adaptation and generalization. - In particular, the authors investigate directly minimizing catastrophic interference as an alternative objective.- They compare MAML, which only maximizes fast adaptation, to MRCL, which minimizes interference, on a continual learning prediction task.- Even though MAML and MRCL achieve similar fast adaptation performance, MRCL significantly outperforms on incremental learning benchmarks.- This suggests that directly training for robustness to interference results in better representations for incremental learning compared to just maximizing fast adaptation.In summary, the key point is that fast adaptation alone is not sufficient - directly optimizing for robustness to interference is important for learning representations suitable for incremental learning. The paper makes this point through empirical comparisons between MAML and MRCL on continual learning prediction tasks.
