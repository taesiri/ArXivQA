# [Temporal and Semantic Evaluation Metrics for Foundation Models in   Post-Hoc Analysis of Robotic Sub-tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17238)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of large-scale, language-annotated robot trajectory data, especially at the granular sub-task level. This hinders the adoption of methods that leverage language supervision to improve robot task performance. 
- Manual collection, cleaning and annotation of such datasets is expensive and not scalable. Some prior works have limitations in terms of cost-effectiveness or level of annotation detail.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose an automated framework that leverages Foundation Models (FMs) like LLMs and VLMs to decompose raw robot trajectory data into sub-tasks with natural language descriptions. 
- They design prompts to provide the trajectory data (states, controls, images) and context to steer the FMs to produce the sub-task decompositions.
- To evaluate the quality of the FM-generated annotations, they propose two similarity metrics - temporal and semantic - to quantify the alignment of the predicted sub-tasks to ground truth sub-tasks.

Main Contributions:
- A prompt engineering methodology and framework for automatic trajectory annotation using FMs 
- Novel temporal and semantic similarity metrics to compare predicted and ground truth sub-task decompositions
- Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrating FM sub-task predictions having >90% similarity to ground truth vs 30% for randomized baseline
- The approach enables building diverse, language-supervised robotics datasets to improve performance on downstream tasks like TAMP

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient, scalable approach for automatic fine-grained annotation of robot trajectories using foundation models. The quality of the generated annotations is rigorously evaluated using proposed temporal and semantic similarity metrics. This enables language-supervised learning on robotics tasks using diverse datasets.
