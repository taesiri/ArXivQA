# [A Survey of Temporal Credit Assignment in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01072)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The credit assignment problem (CAP) refers to the longstanding challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) of associating actions with their long-term consequences. Solving CAP is critical for deploying effective and interpretable RL agents in the real world. However, there is a lack of clarity around what "credit" means mathematically and how to evaluate progress on CAP algorithms. 

The paper identifies three main open questions:
1) What is credit mathematically and how do different works quantify action influences? 
2) What are the main methods to assign credit and how can they be organized?
3) How can we evaluate whether a method improves on CAP challenges?

Solution:
The paper provides a unifying formalism for credit based on an "assignment function" that maps actions, goals, and context to a measure of action influence. It surveys common assignment functions like Q-values and advantage functions. It also proposes principles that a good credit measure should satisfy.

The challenges to credit assignment are categorized along three MDP dimensions: depth, density, breadth. Methods are organized by their heuristics like using time, reward decomposition, goal conditioning, sequence modeling etc.

For evaluation, metrics are divided into those borrowed from control vs bespoke credit assignment metrics. Tasks are differentiated into diagnostic vs scale environments. The paper calls for better benchmarking focused explicitly on credit assignment challenges.

Contributions:
- Formal definition of credit assignment problem using a unifying assignment function
- Identification of 3 core open questions to drive progress
- Categorization of challenges and solutions along MDP dimensions  
- Comprehensive survey and taxonomy of credit assignment methods
- Analysis of evaluation practices and call for improved benchmarks targeting credit assignment

Overall the paper provides a structured perspective of the temporal credit assignment problem to facilitate future advancements in this critical area for interpretable and practical RL agents.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

This survey on temporal credit assignment in deep reinforcement learning proposes a unifying framework to define credit, categorizes methods based on how they assign credit over time, identifies key challenges like delayed rewards and sparse environments, and calls for better benchmarks to evaluate progress.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the field of temporal credit assignment in deep reinforcement learning. Some of the main contributions are:

1) It proposes a formal definition of credit assignment and the credit assignment problem. It defines credit assignment as the problem of estimating the causal influence of an action from a finite amount of experience.

2) It categorizes the main challenges in credit assignment into three dimensions of MDPs - depth, density, and breadth. It discusses how pathological conditions on these dimensions hinder credit assignment. 

3) It provides a taxonomy of the main methods for credit assignment in deep RL, categorizing them based on the heuristics they use like time, return decomposition, auxiliary goals, hindsight conditioning etc.

4) It surveys evaluation protocols and metrics used for credit assignment methods, and discusses open problems and challenges like the lack of proper diagnostic benchmarks and the entanglement between credit assignment and exploration.

5) It provides a unifying perspective to compare different credit assignment methods and discusses properties like explicitness, recursiveness, future-dependency and causality that influence the quality of a credit assignment.

In summary, the main contribution is a structured organization and critical analysis of the temporal credit assignment problem and methods, to provide a foundation for future research to build upon. The discussion on open problems is also valuable for guiding progress.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a formalism to unify different measures of action influence under the concept of an "assignment function." How does this help organize and clarify the different approaches to quantifying action influence in reinforcement learning? What are the limitations of this formalism?

2. The paper defines the "credit assignment problem" formally in terms of learning an accurate assignment function from finite experience data. What assumptions does this definition make? Does it capture all aspects of credit assignment as an RL challenge?

3. The paper categorizes different credit assignment methods based on how they specify the measure of action influence, the protocol to learn it, and the source of experience data. What are other potential ways to categorize credit assignment algorithms and why?

4. Several methods reviewed rely on conditioning value functions on explicit goals or outcomes. What are the potential benefits and downsides of using explicit goal representations? How sensitive are these methods to the choice of goal representation?  

5. Methods using backward planning or learning appear promising for environments with many optimal pathways ("transpositions") to a goal state. Why does propagating credit "backwards" from a goal help identify influential actions in these cases? What limitations remain?

6. Hindsight methods re-evaluate past actions based on actually achieved outcomes. This is shown to help in sparse reward settings. Why does hindsight re-evaluation alleviate sparsity specifically? When would it fail to help?

7. Sequence modelling methods for credit assignment stem from recent advances in NLP. What aspects of these methods hold promise for improving credit assignment? What potential shortcomings need to be addressed?

8. The paper argues current benchmarks are insufficient to systematically evaluate credit assignment methods. What specific criteria should new benchmark environments satisfy? What metrics beyond end task performance could offer better insight? 

9. The relationship between credit assignment and exploration remains unclear. What open questions remain about their interplay? How can we disentangle them experimentally?

10. What theoretical gaps exist in formalizing the key idea of credit assignment? What concepts like "optimal credit" need to be defined more precisely to enable continued progress?
