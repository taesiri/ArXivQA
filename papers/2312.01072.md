# [A Survey of Temporal Credit Assignment in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01072)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The credit assignment problem (CAP) refers to the longstanding challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) of associating actions with their long-term consequences. Solving CAP is critical for deploying effective and interpretable RL agents in the real world. However, there is a lack of clarity around what "credit" means mathematically and how to evaluate progress on CAP algorithms. 

The paper identifies three main open questions:
1) What is credit mathematically and how do different works quantify action influences? 
2) What are the main methods to assign credit and how can they be organized?
3) How can we evaluate whether a method improves on CAP challenges?

Solution:
The paper provides a unifying formalism for credit based on an "assignment function" that maps actions, goals, and context to a measure of action influence. It surveys common assignment functions like Q-values and advantage functions. It also proposes principles that a good credit measure should satisfy.

The challenges to credit assignment are categorized along three MDP dimensions: depth, density, breadth. Methods are organized by their heuristics like using time, reward decomposition, goal conditioning, sequence modeling etc.

For evaluation, metrics are divided into those borrowed from control vs bespoke credit assignment metrics. Tasks are differentiated into diagnostic vs scale environments. The paper calls for better benchmarking focused explicitly on credit assignment challenges.

Contributions:
- Formal definition of credit assignment problem using a unifying assignment function
- Identification of 3 core open questions to drive progress
- Categorization of challenges and solutions along MDP dimensions  
- Comprehensive survey and taxonomy of credit assignment methods
- Analysis of evaluation practices and call for improved benchmarks targeting credit assignment

Overall the paper provides a structured perspective of the temporal credit assignment problem to facilitate future advancements in this critical area for interpretable and practical RL agents.
