# [DeepPointMap: Advancing LiDAR SLAM with Unified Neural Descriptors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02684)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes DeepPointMap (DPM), a novel deep learning framework for LiDAR simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). DPM consists of two neural networks: the DPM Encoder extracts highly compact yet representative neural descriptors from raw point clouds to enable efficient map representation, while the DPM Decoder performs multi-scale matching and registration based on these descriptors to accomplish accurate localization tasks including odometry and loop closure. Compared to traditional geometric pipelines and learning-based methods limited to single-scale inputs, DPM provides a unified architecture to jointly address various SLAM sub-tasks. Through extensive experiments on challenging autonomous driving datasets, DPM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in localization accuracy and memory efficiency. Notably, it succeeds in large-scale environments where other methods struggle or fail. The compactness and versatility of DPM's neural descriptors further allow extending the framework to multi-agent cooperative SLAM with constrained communication overhead. In summary, DPM offers an effective learning-based solution to advance LiDAR SLAM research towards intelligent autonomous systems.
