# [A machine learning workflow to address credit default prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03785)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of credit default prediction (CDP), which refers to assessing the probability that a borrower will default on their loan obligations. Accurate CDP enables lenders to make informed decisions about approving loans and managing risk. However, CDP is challenging due to complex financial data patterns. While statistical models lack sufficient predictive power, machine learning approaches like deep learning have shown promise for CDP.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a workflow-based machine learning approach to improve CDP. The key components of the workflow are:

1) Data Preprocessing: Apply Weight of Evidence (WoE) encoding technique to handle outliers, missing values and transform features into uniform scale.

2) Model Training: Train multiple families of models - statistical (logistic regression), machine learning (classification trees, random forests) and deep learning (MLP, Ensemble MLP).

3) Ensemble Strategy: Ensemble the models to improve robustness.

4) Hyperparameter Optimization: Tune hyperparameters via multi-objective NSGA-II algorithm to maximize both accuracy (AUC) and profitability (Expected Maximum Profit).  

5) Evaluation: Assess model performance on benchmark datasets using classification (AUC, F1) and financial (Brier Score, Expected Max Profit) metrics.

Main Contributions:
- A systematic workflow combining strengths of different techniques (WoE, ensembles, NSGA-II) for improving CDP.
- Tuning models to optimize both accuracy and profitability metrics.
- Analysis of workflow components and performance benchmarks on public datasets.
- A reproducible framework with public code release to serve as a baseline for further research.

The paper demonstrates how the proposed workflow outperforms individual models across multiple datasets. The integration of business objectives and domain knowledge into the machine learning process allows for developing more useful real-world CDP tools.
