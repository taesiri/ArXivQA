# [Convergence Rates for Stochastic Approximation: Biased Noise with   Unbounded Variance, and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02828)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents several new theoretical contributions to the analysis of stochastic approximation (SA) algorithms. It relaxes common assumptions on the noise terms, allowing for non-zero mean and unbounded variance, and also considers asynchronous updating where only one parameter component is updated per time step. The authors provide convergence guarantees for SA under these relaxed assumptions, as well as finite time analysis bounding the convergence rates. Key applications considered are nonconvex optimization with stochastic gradient methods using either true but noisy gradients or approximate gradients based on noisy function evaluations. For both settings, the optimal convergence rate is shown to be only slightly slower than the noiseless case, demonstrating the power of SA. The results are also applied to bound the convergence rate of temporal difference learning in reinforcement learning. Overall, the paper significantly expands the range of applicability of SA theory to broader classes of problems with relaxed noise assumptions and intermittent parameter updates.
