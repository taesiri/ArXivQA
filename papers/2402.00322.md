# [Bias in Opinion Summarisation from Pre-training to Adaptation: A Case   Study in Political Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00322)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Opinion summarisation aims to summarise opinions from documents into short summaries. However, generated summaries can be biased and sway public opinion. 
- Prior work studied bias mainly in extractive models using social attributes, but little on abstractive models.

Objectives:
- Establish a methodology to quantify bias in abstractive summarisation models using political bias as a case study. 
- Trace bias from pre-trained models to the task of summarising social media opinions using different models and adaptation methods.

Methods:
- Propose a classifier to label sentences in summaries as left/right-leaning and a metric called Second-order SPD to measure bias.
- Apply various pre-trained models (BART, T5, GPT-2) in zero-shot and adapted settings to summarise a Twitter dataset.
- Compare standard fine-tuning to methods that update smaller parameters sets (adapter tuning, prefix tuning).
- Evaluate model fairness across different input distributions of political stances.

Key Findings:
- Most models exhibit intrinsic political bias, better at exposing left than right opinions.  
- Fine-tuning amplifies intrinsic bias, shifts models to be more left-leaning.
- Updating smaller parameter sets less biased than full fine-tuning, but diversity of training data is critical.
- Adapter tuning strikes a balance between performance and lower bias.

Main Contributions:
- Methodology to quantify bias in abstractive summarisation models
- Analysis tracing bias from pre-training to task adaptation with different methods
- Guidelines for model selection and adaptation to minimize bias

The paper makes important progress in understanding and mitigating bias risks in abstractive opinion summarisation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper examines bias in abstractive opinion summarization models, finds most models exhibit intrinsic bias which is amplified by fine-tuning, and shows that adapter tuning introduces relatively less bias while maintaining performance compared to standard fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper introduces a methodology to quantify bias in abstractive opinion summarization models using political bias as a case study. This includes using a classifier to identify political opinions in generated summaries and defining a fairness metric called "Second-order SPD" to measure bias.

2) The paper traces bias from pre-trained language models to the downstream task of summarizing social media opinions using different models and adaptation methods. It finds that most models exhibit intrinsic bias that propagates to the summarization task.

3) The paper examines how different adaptation methods for fine-tuning models, such as standard fine-tuning, adapter tuning, prefix tuning, etc. affect the bias introduced. It finds tuning a smaller number of parameters can result in less bias compared to standard fine-tuning.

4) The paper also finds that the diversity of topics in the fine-tuning data is critical, especially when tuning a smaller number of parameters. Narrow fine-tuning data can diminish the benefits of reducing bias.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing a methodology to quantify bias in abstractive summarization models and tracing how bias propagates from pre-training to adaptation using a case study of political bias and social media summarization.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Opinion summarisation - The task of summarizing opinions expressed in documents like product reviews, social media posts, etc.

- Political bias - The paper specifically looks at political leanings (left vs right) as a case study of bias.

- Abstractive summarization models - The paper focuses on evaluating bias in abstractive models which generate summaries by paraphrasing.

- Fairness - The paper defines fairness for opinion summarization and proposes a metric to quantify bias.

- Pre-trained language models (PLMs) - Models like BART, T5, GPT-2 which exhibit societal biases. 

- Adaptation methods - Methods like standard fine-tuning, adapter tuning, prefix tuning that are used to adapt PLMs for downstream tasks.

- Social media text - The paper looks at summarization of Twitter threads and evaluates bias in summarizing such opinionated text.

- Intrinsic bias - The innate bias models exhibit even in a zero-shot setting before being adapted.

So in summary, the key terms cover opinion summarization, political bias, abstractive models, fairness notions, language model training, and social media text summarization.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How does the paper define fairness when generating summaries of opinions from social media text? What are the key ideas behind this definition?

2. What is the intuition behind using the second-order statistical parity difference (SPD) metric to quantify bias in abstractive summarization models? Why was this preferred over standard divergence measures? 

3. What were the key findings regarding intrinsic bias in pre-trained language models when tested in a zero-shot summarization setting? How did bias manifest across models of different sizes and architectures?

4. When comparing adaptation methods, what tradeoffs emerged between model performance and introduced bias? Which method achieved a good balance?

5. Why did the benefit of bias reduction diminish when tuning smaller parameter sets on narrow, single topics? What does this suggest about the role of training data diversity?  

6. What differences emerged in model bias when trained and tested on COVID vs. elections data? What might account for these topical differences?

7. How exactly does the proposed pipeline classify the political stance of individual sentences in generated summaries? What role does ChatGPT play?

8. What limitations exist in equating political bias to a simple left vs. right lean? How could future work address this limitation with more nuanced ideological distinctions?  

9. How might the overall methodological approach extend to studying other types of bias, such as gender or racial bias? What components are reusable?

10. What specific guidelines or safeguards might help prevent generated opinion summaries from being used to unfairly sway public perceptions on social issues?
