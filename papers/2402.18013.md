# [A Survey on Recent Advances in LLM-Based Multi-turn Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18013)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of research on multi-turn dialogue systems, with a focus on systems based on large language models (LLMs). 

The paper first gives background on multi-turn dialogue systems, categorizing them into task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems that assist users in specific domains, and open-domain dialogue (ODD) systems that can chat about a wide range of topics. It discusses how LLMs like GPT-3 have significantly advanced the capabilities of these systems recently.

The paper then provides a thorough overview of different types of LLMs, categorizing them by model structure into encoder-decoder, decoder-only, and encoder-only architectures. It introduces prominent LLMs in each category like GPT, BART, BERT, and T5, highlighting their key innovations.  

Next, the paper elaborates methods for adapting LLMs to downstream tasks via fine-tuning and prompt engineering. It covers techniques like full fine-tuning, adapter modules, and prefix tuning to incorporate task knowledge into models. It also discusses prompt-based methods that formulate instructions to guide LLMs without parameter updates.

The paper then dives into LLMs for multi-turn dialogue, analyzing recent advances in both TOD and ODD systems. For TOD, it examines pipeline methods using LLMs for components like state tracking, policy learning and response generation as well as end-to-end approaches. For ODD, it explores retrieval-based, generation-based and hybrid methods enhanced by LLMs.

The paper also introduces datasets and evaluation metrics used to benchmark progress, including resources like MultiWOZ, CrossWOZ and PersonaChat. It concludes by discussing open challenges as dialogue systems and LLMs continue advancing.

In summary, this comprehensive survey explores the intersection of LLMs with multi-turn dialogue systems, providing an in-depth analysis of methods, architectures, applications and directions in this increasingly important area. The detailed overview can inform both researchers and practitioners working on the next generation of conversational agents.
