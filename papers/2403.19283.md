# [Ungrammatical-syntax-based In-context Example Selection for Grammatical   Error Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19283)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Grammatical error correction (GEC) aims to automatically correct grammatical errors in text. However, large language models (LLMs) still lag behind conventional models on GEC.  
- In-context learning (ICL) is an effective strategy to improve LLMs' performance by providing demonstration examples. But no existing work on ICL example selection utilizes syntactic information, which is important for syntax-oriented tasks like GEC.

Method: 
- The paper proposes a novel ICL example selection method for GEC based on ungrammatical syntactic similarity. 
- It computes syntactic similarities between test input and training sentences using tree kernel and polynomial distance algorithms on dependency trees from GOPar, a GEC-oriented parser.
- A two-stage selection strategy is explored: first selecting candidates with BM25/BERT, then ranking examples by syntactic similarity.

Contributions:
- First work introducing syntactic knowledge to ICL example selection for GEC.
- A two-stage selection framework combining superficial word similarity methods and deep syntax similarity methods.
- Experimental results show the syntax-based methods outperform conventional baselines, especially with two-stage selection. The best method improves performance by ~3 F0.5 points on average.
- Calls attention back to the significance of syntactic information for NLP tasks.

In summary, this paper proposes an ungrammatical-syntax-based in-context example selection approach to improve the performance of LLMs on the grammatical error correction task. The key innovation is leveraging syntactic similarity between ungrammatical sentences. Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this syntax-aware selection strategy.
