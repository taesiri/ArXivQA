# [Adversarially Robust Spiking Neural Networks Through Conversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09266)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel adversarially robust ANN-to-SNN conversion algorithm to improve the resilience of spiking neural networks (SNNs) against adversarial attacks. The method first trains a robust artificial neural network (ANN) using state-of-the-art adversarial training techniques. This robust ANN is then converted into an SNN by replacing activations with spiking neurons while keeping the weights intact. A key innovation is the technique to incorporate adversarial batch norm parameters from the ANN into the SNN. After conversion, the SNN is further finetuned using adversarial examples to update both weights and layer-wise thresholds. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the approach transfers robustness from the ANN to achieve state-of-the-art adversarial accuracy on SNNs. For instance, on CIFAR-10 the method attains 2x higher robustness over prior art using end-to-end trained SNNs, with reduced accuracy-robustness tradeoff. The conversion technique embraces various ANN adversarial training schemes to enable scalable robust learning for SNNs. Overall, the work makes an important contribution towards developing reliable and secure SNN-based AI applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an adversarially robust ANN-to-SNN conversion algorithm that transfers robustness from a pre-trained ANN into an SNN via adversarial finetuning of both connectivity weights and layer-wise firing thresholds, achieving state-of-the-art robustness for deep SNNs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an adversarially robust ANN-to-SNN conversion algorithm that exploits robustly trained baseline ANN weights at initialization, followed by an adversarial finetuning method to improve the robustness of the converted SNN. Specifically, the key aspects are:

1) Converting a robustly trained ANN into an SNN by adversarially finetuning both the synaptic connectivity weights and layer-wise firing thresholds after initialization. This allows transferring robustness gains from the ANN to the SNN.

2) Introducing a novel way to incorporate adversarially trained ANN batch-norm layer parameters into spatio-temporal batch norm operations in the SNN after conversion. This facilitates robust training without omitting batch norm layers.

3) Presenting extensive experimental analyses with adaptive white-box and black-box adversarial attacks tailored for SNN evaluations. The proposed conversion approach is shown to achieve state-of-the-art robustness for deep SNNs, outperforming recent end-to-end adversarial training methods.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a principled and scalable ANN-to-SNN conversion methodology to obtain low-latency yet adversarially robust spiking neural networks.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the adversarially robust ANN-to-SNN conversion method proposed in the paper:

Discuss the limitations of direct adversarial SNN training that the proposed conversion method aims to address. 

2. The conversion algorithm initializes SNN weights from an adversarially trained ANN and then performs robust finetuning. Elaborate on the specific strategies used for setting initial firing thresholds and incorporating batch normalization layers from the ANN. How do these impact the final robustness?

3. The paper introduces a novel robust finetuning loss function for the SNN after conversion. Explain the formulation of this loss and discuss why the specific choice of KL divergence and cross entropy terms is beneficial for improving robustness. 

4. The method uses single-step RFGSM to craft adversarial examples during finetuning. Analyze the tradeoffs between using multi-step PGD vs single-step RFGSM in this context. Also discuss the impact of the $\alpha$ hyperparameter.  

5. The paper emphasizes the use of an ensemble of white-box attacks with diverse surrogate gradients for reliable evaluation. Elaborate on this argument and analyze results in Table 2 that showcase differences between individual attacks.

8. The method can incorporate any ANN adversarial training algorithm as a baseline for conversion. Discuss how the choice of different baseline algorithms such as standard AT vs TRADES impacts final SNN performance.

9. For black-box evaluations, discuss why converted SNNs demonstrate higher resilience than baseline ANNs. Does this observation also hold for white-box scenarios? Explain.

10. The paper demonstrates improved out-of-distribution generalization with adversarial training. Analyze these results and discuss why adversarial robustness might be linked with better corruption robustness.
