# [NeoNeXt: Novel neural network operator and architecture based on the   patch-wise matrix multiplications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11251)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing neural network architectures have limitations when deployed on specialized AI hardware like neural processing units (NPUs). For example, operations like im2col used in convolutions increase memory usage.
- Depthwise convolutions used in models like MobileNet also have high memory overhead during inference.
- Hardware-friendly architectures typically just search over existing operators, limiting further optimizations. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces a new operator called NeoCell that replaces depthwise convolutions. It splits input data into patches and multiplies them with trainable matrices from left and right.
- NeoCell reduces computational complexity compared to depthwise convolutions, especially for large kernels. It also avoids memory overhead of im2col.
- Allows flexible upsampling and downsampling by using non-square matrices.
- Proposes NeoNeXt architectures that replace depthwise convolutions in ConvNeXt with NeoCell. Adds optimizations like batch norm instead of layer norm.

Main Contributions:
- Novel NeoCell operator that is more hardware-friendly than depthwise convolutions
- NeoNeXt architecture family that replaces depthwise convs in ConvNeXt with NeoCell
- Achieves competitive ImageNet accuracy to other models while being more parameter and compute efficient
- Proposes NeoInit scheme to initialize NeoCell matrices that improves training stability 
- Opens research directions like optimized implementations, architecture search with NeoCell, and applications in other vision tasks

The paper shows NeoCell is a promising basic building block for specialized hardware that balances efficiency and accuracy. While not beating state-of-the-art yet, NeoNeXt models demonstrate viability of the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel neural network layer called NeoCell that performs patchwise matrix multiplications on the input and builds a family of models called NeoNeXt that replaces depthwise convolutions with NeoCells, achieving competitive image classification performance on ImageNet while being more parameter-efficient.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new neural network operator called "NeoCell" and a family of architectures called "NeoNeXt" built using this operator. Specifically:

- The NeoCell operator performs patchwise matrix multiplications between the input data and learned weight matrices. This replaces depthwise convolutions and has lower computational complexity.

- NeoCell enables flexible upsampling and downsampling by using non-square matrices. It also allows information exchange between channels and patches in various ways.

- The NeoNeXt architecture family uses NeoCell as a basic building block instead of depthwise convolutions. Experiments on ImageNet classification validate NeoCell as a viable operator choice, with NeoNeXt models achieving competitive accuracy to other architectures.

In summary, the key innovation is the NeoCell operator and demonstration of its capabilities by constructing the NeoNeXt family of neural network architectures for computer vision. The experiments prove it can replace depthwise convolutions and achieve strong performance on image classification tasks.
