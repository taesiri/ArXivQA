# [NeoNeXt: Novel neural network operator and architecture based on the   patch-wise matrix multiplications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11251)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing neural network architectures have limitations when deployed on specialized AI hardware like neural processing units (NPUs). For example, operations like im2col used in convolutions increase memory usage.
- Depthwise convolutions used in models like MobileNet also have high memory overhead during inference.
- Hardware-friendly architectures typically just search over existing operators, limiting further optimizations. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces a new operator called NeoCell that replaces depthwise convolutions. It splits input data into patches and multiplies them with trainable matrices from left and right.
- NeoCell reduces computational complexity compared to depthwise convolutions, especially for large kernels. It also avoids memory overhead of im2col.
- Allows flexible upsampling and downsampling by using non-square matrices.
- Proposes NeoNeXt architectures that replace depthwise convolutions in ConvNeXt with NeoCell. Adds optimizations like batch norm instead of layer norm.

Main Contributions:
- Novel NeoCell operator that is more hardware-friendly than depthwise convolutions
- NeoNeXt architecture family that replaces depthwise convs in ConvNeXt with NeoCell
- Achieves competitive ImageNet accuracy to other models while being more parameter and compute efficient
- Proposes NeoInit scheme to initialize NeoCell matrices that improves training stability 
- Opens research directions like optimized implementations, architecture search with NeoCell, and applications in other vision tasks

The paper shows NeoCell is a promising basic building block for specialized hardware that balances efficiency and accuracy. While not beating state-of-the-art yet, NeoNeXt models demonstrate viability of the approach.
