# [Technical Report for Argoverse Challenges on Unified Sensor-based   Detection, Tracking, and Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15615)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

This paper presents a unified end-to-end framework called Le3DE2E for multi-sensor 3D detection, tracking and motion forecasting using the Argoverse 2 dataset. The method leverages both LiDAR point clouds and camera images which are encoded into bird's eye view (BEV) representations and fused together. These fused spatial-temporal features are fed into detector, tracker and motion forecasting heads. The detector is based on Deformable DETR and predicts 3D boxes without NMS. The tracker initializes from detector outputs and associates objects across frames. The motion forecasting head uses transformers and incorporates vectorized HD maps to predict future trajectories. The system achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking 1st place on the Argoverse Challenges 2023 for the end-to-end forecasting track on detection, tracking and motion forecasting. Key innovations include effectively fusing multi-sensor inputs into a unified BEV, strong transformer-based detector and motion forecasting, and an end-to-end tracking framework.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a unified end-to-end framework for detection, tracking, and forecasting of objects from sensor data for autonomous driving applications. Specifically, the paper proposes:

- A unified network that incorporates detection, tracking, and forecasting tasks using a shared representation. This uses a strong bird's eye view (BEV) encoder that fuses LiDAR and camera features with spatial and temporal fusion.

- The system ranked 1st place in the detection, tracking, and forecasting challenges in the End-to-End Forecasting track of the Argoverse competition at CVPR 2023. This demonstrates the effectiveness of their proposed unified framework on a benchmark autonomous driving dataset.

In summary, the key contribution is an end-to-end model for multiple perception tasks that placed 1st in a major autonomous driving competition by leveraging a shared representation and effectively fusing multiple sensor modalities.
