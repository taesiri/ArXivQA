# [Scaling Political Texts with ChatGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16639)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper evaluates the ability of GPT-4, a large language model, to locate text documents along continuous ideological and policy dimensions. The authors focus on two main tasks: positioning British party manifestos on economic, social, and immigration policy scales, and positioning tweets by members of the U.S. Congress on a left-right ideological scale. They then aggregate the tweet positions to estimate senator positions. The positions estimated by GPT-4 achieve very high correlation (93-98%) with expert surveys and crowdsourced ratings for the party manifestos, and 91-97% correlation with estimates based on voting records and campaign donations for the senators. The high reliability and validity demonstrate that querying GPT-4 is a fast, cost-efficient, and reliable approach to scaling text documents and authors ideologically. This provides a viable lower-cost alternative to relying solely on expert coders or crowd workers for such tasks. The ability to reliably position short social media posts also enables studying the dynamics of political discourse and beliefs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper develops and validates a new approach using GPT-4 to estimate the positions of political texts such as party manifestos and tweets on ideological dimensions, finding it performs as well as or better than estimates from experts or crowdsourcing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing and validating a new approach for using GPT-4 to obtain position estimates of political texts in continuous ideological and policy spaces. Specifically:

1) The paper shows that by directly querying GPT-4 for the position of text documents (e.g. party manifestos, tweets) on ideological dimensions, the model can produce estimates that have very high correlation (93% or higher) with expert surveys and crowdsourced estimates.

2) The paper demonstrates that the positions obtained by scaling individual tweets with GPT-4 can then be effectively aggregated to estimate the ideological positions of political actors like US Senators. These GPT-4 estimates achieve 97% correlation with alternate measures based on roll-call votes and campaign donations.

3) The results indicate that using GPT-4 for scaling text documents in continuous ideological spaces is fast, cost-efficient and reliable. The authors argue it provides a viable alternative to expert coding or crowdsourcing for these tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting and validating a novel methodology for exploiting GPT-4's knowledge about political ideologies to scale text documents produced by political actors on policy and ideological dimensions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this paper include:

ChatGPT, ideology, scaling, text as data, party manifestos, tweets, senators, roll-call votes, campaign funding, left-right ideology, policy dimensions, crowdsourcing, expert surveys

The paper examines using ChatGPT/GPT-4 to estimate the ideological positions of political texts such as party manifestos and tweets along continuous policy dimensions. It validates this approach by comparing the positions estimated by GPT-4 to other estimates based on expert surveys, crowdsourcing, roll-call votes, and campaign donations. The key focus areas are scaling political texts, ideology, left-right spectrum, validation against other methods, and the use of ChatGPT specifically for this positioning task.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares the performance of GPT-4 in positioning texts to expert surveys and crowdsourcing. What are some potential limitations of using expert surveys and crowdsourcing for text scaling that GPT-4 may help overcome?

2. The paper finds that providing more detailed explanations of the policy dimensions to GPT-4 did not improve performance over just using the basic scale descriptions. Why might this be the case? What does this suggest about GPT-4's inherent understanding of political concepts?

3. For positioning the tweets, the paper uses the average scores from multiple GPT-4 responses as the position estimate. How might the variability across the GPT-4 responses influence the resulting position estimates? Would alternative aggregation methods, like taking the median or mode, impact results?

4. Could the high correlation between GPT-4 tweet positions and senator positions based on votes/donations partly reflect GPT-4 just associating politicians with parties? How could the method be refined to better capture intra-party variation in positions?  

5. The sample of tweets used to estimate senator positions is random. How might a more systematic sampling strategy, for example focusing on politically salient tweets, impact resulting position estimates?

6. For manifesto positioning, the paper breaks up long texts into shorter chunks. How might the chunking approach impact results compared to submitting full texts? Could the context of surrounding paragraphs change implied positions?

7. The paper demonstrates high reliability in terms of correlations for text scaling tasks. However, what about validity? How could the face validity of positions be further evaluated beyond correlations with other estimates?

8. How might the choice of scale endpoints impact results? For example, using "very liberal" vs "very progressive" at the left end of a social policy scale. Do different scale anchor labels change GPT-4's positioning?

9. Could the performance of GPT-4 for text scaling depend significantly on the context time period? Might performance degrade for historical texts as language use changes over time? How could model robustness to time period be evaluated?

10. The paper focuses on a few specific scaling dimensions. How difficult might it be to adapt the approach to construct positions on alternative policy dimensions that are less commonly analyzed in political science? What challenges might arise?
