# [A Sparsity Principle for Partially Observable Causal Representation   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08335)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on causal representation learning (CRL) in a partially observable setting, where each observation only captures a subset of the underlying causal variables, instead of the complete causal state as assumed in prior work. Specifically, the paper considers an unpaired setting where the observations do not come as matched pairs capturing the same underlying state, and allows for instance-dependent partial observability patterns, meaning the subset of captured variables can change across observations of different states. This is practically motivated by applications like a static camera taking pictures of a scene with objects moving in and out of frame. The goal is to recover the latent causal variables from these incomplete observations.  

Proposed Solution:
The key insight is that enforcing a sparsity constraint on the learned representations can break indeterminacies and enable identification, similar to how humans can infer the position of occluded objects based on available context. The paper presents two theoretical identifiability results, one for linear mixing functions and one for piecewise linear mixing functions when the causal variables are Gaussian, both relying on exploiting sparsity:

1. For linear mixing, the main assumption is sufficient variability in the subsets of captured variables across observations. A sparsity + perfect reconstruction constraint provably recovers a disentangled representation. 

2. For piecewise linear mixing, additional assumptions of Gaussian causal variables and known partitioning of the data by observability pattern is required. A sparsity + perfect reconstruction + Gaussianity constraint can identify the causal variables.

The paper proposes two methods implementing the theoretical results, with experiments on simulated and image datasets highlighting their effectiveness in recovering ground truth factors in the partial observability setting.

Main Contributions:
- Formalization of the unpaired partial observation setting for CRL 
- Two identifiability results leveraging sparsity for linear and piecewise linear mixing 
- Proposed methods implementing the theory and experiments validating recovery of latent variables on multiple datasets

The main insight is exploiting sparsity for identifiability under partial observability, enabling learning causal representations from incomplete observations, with practical applications like inferring positions of occluded objects from images.
