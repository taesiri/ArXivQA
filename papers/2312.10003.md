# [ReST meets ReAct: Self-Improvement for Multi-Step Reasoning LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10003)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Answering complex natural language questions often requires multi-step reasoning and integrating external information. Existing systems that combine knowledge retrieval with large language models (LLMs) suffer from failure cases. 
- These systems are not end-to-end differentiable due to interaction with non-differentiable external knowledge. So we cannot directly train them to fix failure cases.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper defines a ReAct-style LLM agent with explicit reasoning and action steps to answer questions by searching and summarizing information.
- It refines the agent through a ReST-like method with growing-batch reinforcement learning using AI feedback for continuous self-improvement and self-distillation.

Key Contributions:
- Defines a flavor of ReAct agent with self-critique for long-form question answering using a search tool.
- Introduces a proxy evaluation metric using Bamboogle and BamTwoogle datasets with emphasis on auto-eval.
- Shows agent performance can be improved through Rest-style iterative fine-tuning purely from stepwise AI feedback without human-labeled data.
- Demonstrates the synthetic data from self-improvement iterations can distill the agent into smaller models with comparable performance. For example, after two iterations, a fine-tuned small model achieves performance close to the pre-trained large model teacher.

In summary, the paper presents an iterative self-improvement framework to train an LLM agent for multi-step reasoning and knowledge integration without human involvement. The trained agent also allows distillation into much smaller models while preserving most of the performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an iterative self-improvement algorithm for a search-based question answering agent, using growing-batch reinforcement learning with AI feedback to improve performance and enable efficient self-distillation into much smaller models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a method for iteratively improving a reasoning LLM agent through self-generated feedback and synthetic data without requiring human-labeled training data. Specifically:

1) They build a ReAct-style search agent capable of multi-step reasoning and explicit attribution when answering open-ended questions. 

2) They propose an iterative self-improvement procedure inspired by ReST, where the agent generates its own training data by rolling out trajectories. At each iteration, the data quality improves as the policy improves.

3) They show this allows "distilling" the agent's reasoning ability into much smaller models with minimal performance loss - they demonstrate comparable performance with models two orders of magnitude smaller after two iterations.

4) They introduce an automatic evaluation metric using the Bamboogle dataset as a proxy for agent performance, which allows efficient hyperparameter tuning and performance tracking.

In summary, the key contribution is enabling automated self-improvement and distillation for reasoning agents without human intervention by using algorithmic task decomposition and synthetic data.

The paper discusses using an LLM agent based on the ReAct framework to perform multi-step reasoning and integrate external knowledge in order to answer complex compositional questions. It focuses on methods for the agent to self-improve through iterative training on its own generated trajectories with AI feedback, as well as distilling itself into smaller models. Key concepts include leveraging process supervision instead of human labels, using growing batch reinforcement learning techniques like ReST, and utilizing AI ranking models rather than human preferences. The end goal is developing an agent that can self-reflect and continuously enhance its reasoning and question answering abilities.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a "code as prompt" approach for defining the agent's reasoning steps. What are the main motivations behind this design choice? What are some potential limitations of using code prompts?

2. The paper relies heavily on auto-eval with a separate LLM call for measuring agent performance instead of human evaluations. What are some key advantages and disadvantages of using auto-eval in this context? How reliable and unbiased can we expect auto-eval to be?

3. The ReST-style self-improvement algorithm seems to work well in this setting. How does it compare to other related self-improvement techniques like STAR or RAFT? What are some key differences in the approach? 

4. The paper demonstrates agent improvement over two rounds of ReST-style fine-tuning. What do you think is a reasonable upper bound on the number of fine-tuning rounds before hitting a performance plateau? How can we estimate saturation?

5. The paper relies purely on AI feedback and does not use any human preferences or labels. Do you think some amount of human feedback can further boost the performance? What is a good hybrid approach balancing human efforts and automation?

6. The agent uses a single tool (search API) in its reasoning process. How do you think the self-improvement approach would work for handling multiple tools? Can the ability to handle new, unseen tools be acquired automatically?

7. The paper focuses on question answering as the end task. How easily can this approach be adapted to other complex reasoning tasks like dialog, debate, or even code generation? What components are mostly task-agnostic?

8. The paper demonstrates self-distillation capabilities from the synthetic self-improvement data. What other capabilities can be imparted to smaller models through this distillation process? Can we match a larger model on more than just performance?

9. The paper relies on sampling from the model at each reasoning step. How sensitive is the overall approach to the sampling algorithm and temperature values used? What alternate sampling schemes can potentially work better?

10. The set of tools and datasets used in the paper is limited due to computational constraints. What data and scale of experiments would convincingly showcase the full potential of this method? What benchmarks can serve as a good testbed?
