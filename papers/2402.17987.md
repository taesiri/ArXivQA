# [Multistatic-Radar RCS-Signature Recognition of Aerial Vehicles: A   Bayesian Fusion Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17987)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Radar automated target recognition (RATR) of drones/UAVs is important for defense and security applications. 
- Prior work has shown benefits of using multistatic radar configurations over monostatic, but fusion methods commonly used for combining data from multiple radars are suboptimal from a probabilistic perspective.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a fully Bayesian RATR framework for UAV type classification that utilizes optimal Bayesian fusion (OBF) to aggregate data from multiple radars. 
- At each time step, radar cross section (RCS) measurements from individual radars are fed into local discriminative ML models to output probability vectors on UAV type.
- These individual probability vectors are fused using OBF to form a joint posterior distribution on UAV type based on current observations.
- This posterior is used to update a separate recursive Bayesian classification (RBC) posterior on UAV type based on all historical observations.

Main Contributions:
- First paper to provide a fully Bayesian RATR system for UAV classification using RCS time series data and Bayesian fusion principles.
- Empirically demonstrates that integrating OBF method with RBC significantly enhances performance compared to single radar system and other common fusion rules like soft voting.
- Proposed approach shows improved classification accuracy and robustness against noise, with over 35% higher accuracy at 0 dB SNR compared to baseline systems.
- Method also achieves desired classification accuracy with shorter dwell time versus baselines.
- Framework facilitates efficient use of training data and informed probabilistic classification decisions.

In summary, the key innovation is the introduction of a Bayesian fusion approach for aggregating RCS measurements from a multistatic radar system to perform optimized UAV classification in a principled, probabilistic manner. Both accuracy and noise robustness are enhanced.
