# [DySLIM: Dynamics Stable Learning by Invariant Measure for Chaotic   Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04467)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Learning accurate and stable dynamics from chaotic systems like weather models is very challenging. Small errors get exponentially amplified over time due to the positive Lyapunov exponents of these systems, causing predicted trajectories to diverge rapidly. Existing methods that minimize trajectory errors are unable to capture long-term statistics well.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new framework called DySLIM that targets learning both the short-term dynamics and long-term statistics of chaotic systems. The key ideas are:

1) Leverage the attractor and invariant measure that many chaotic systems exhibit. The attractor is the region trajectories converge to, and supports an invariant probability distribution that represents the long-term statistics.  

2) Formulate the learning problem as matching the invariant measure of the model to that of the real system, along with matching short-term trajectories. This is done via an MMD regularization loss between sampled invariant measures.

3) Approximate sampling from the model's invariant measure by unrolling trajectories for long times. This allows tractable estimation of the MMD loss.

4) Use both unconditional and conditional MMD losses for better finite-sample behavior.

Contributions:

1) A general probabilistic framework for learning chaotic system dynamics and long-term statistics via invariant measure matching.

2) A tractable and scalable objective function called DySLIM implementing this framework, which can work with any existing dynamical system learning approach.

3) Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on several chaotic systems including Lorenz-63, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and Navier-Stokes Kolmogorov flow. The method is more robust to hyperparameters and works on larger systems than prior probabilistic approaches.

4) Showed improved short-term accuracy and long-term stability compared to regular training objectives across systems and metrics. The principle of invariant measure regularization could be beneficial for related domains like weather forecasting.
