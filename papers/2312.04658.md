# [PAC-Bayes Generalization Certificates for Learned Inductive Conformal   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04658)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Inductive conformal prediction (ICP) is an effective method for equipping machine learning models with uncertainty estimates in the form of set-valued predictions. These set predictions are guaranteed to contain the true label with high probability (called the coverage guarantee). However, the sets generated by ICP may be very large (inefficient), depending on the model and choice of score function. Recent work has focused on directly optimizing efficiency by learning model and score function parameters on a calibration dataset. However, optimizing empirical efficiency can lead to overfitting - losing generalization guarantees on coverage and efficiency.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes using PAC-Bayes theory to obtain generalization bounds on both the coverage and efficiency of ICP set predictors. This allows the entire calibration dataset to be used to optimize efficiency while retaining guarantees that hold for test data. Specifically:

1) PAC-Bayes bounds are derived on the test-time coverage and efficiency of randomized ICP predictors where the score function parameters are sampled from a posterior distribution. 

2) These bounds lead to a practical algorithm for constrained optimization of efficiency: the KL divergence between the posterior and prior parameters acts as a budget for optimization that preserves the generalization guarantees.

3) This approach allows the whole calibration set to be used for simultaneous efficiency optimization and coverage calibration. In contrast, prior work requires splitting data between optimization and recalibration.

Main Contributions:

- PAC-Bayes generalization bounds on both coverage and efficiency of ICP set predictors

- Practical algorithm to optimize efficiency subject to constraints that ensure test-time coverage  

- Demonstrates improved efficiency over baselines, especially in small data regimes

- Allows using full calibration set for optimization instead of requiring a held-out recalibration set

The proposed method is evaluated on regression and image classification tasks, demonstrating improved efficiency compared to calibrated baselines, particularly when calibration data is limited.
