# [On the Convergence of Adam under Non-uniform Smoothness: Separability   from SGDM and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15146)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper aims to provide a theoretical comparison between the convergence rates of the Adam optimizer and Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) under the condition of non-uniform smoothness. 
- Prior works have shown SGDM can match lower bounds on convergence rates under common assumptions like uniform smoothness. However, Adam often performs better empirically, presenting a gap in understanding.  
- Recent works observe that neural network training violates the uniform smoothness assumption, motivating the use of non-uniform smoothness concepts like (L0,L1)-smoothness. But existing convergence results for Adam under such settings have limitations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides an improved analysis of Adam's convergence rate under (L0,L1)-smoothness in deterministic and stochastic settings.  
- For deterministic case, Adam's rate matches known lower bounds while a new lower bound for Gradient Descent with Momentum (GDM) shows worse dependency on initial function value gap. This separates Adam and GDM.
- For stochastic setting, Adam's rate matches known lower bounds on both initial function value and final error. In contrast, examples show SGDM can fail to converge irrespective of hyperparameters. This separates Adam and SGDM.

Main Contributions:  
- First work clearly distinguishing convergence rates of Adam and (S)GDM under non-uniform smoothness. Shows Adam's faster convergence.
- Establishes tight problem-dependent convergence rates for Adam matching known lower bounds. Introduces novel stopping time technique.
- Demonstrates the stopping time technique can prove Adam with specific scheduler is parameter-agnostic. The technique is of independent interest.

In summary, the paper provides valuable new theoretical results that help explain Adam's strong empirical performance over SGDM. The analyses also reveal techniques like stopping times that can enable tighter understanding of adaptive methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper: 

The paper separates the convergence rates of Adam and Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) under the condition of non-uniform smoothness, demonstrating that Adam achieves faster convergence compared to SGDM, matching known lower bounds for first-order deterministic and stochastic optimizers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It clearly separates the convergence rates of the Adam optimizer and Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) under the condition of non-uniform smoothness. 

2. In the deterministic setting, it shows that Adam can match the known lower bound of convergence rate for first-order deterministic optimizers, while Gradient Descent with Momentum (GDM) has a higher order dependence on the initial function value gap. This distinguishes Adam and GDM regarding convergence rates.

3. In the stochastic setting, it shows that Adam's convergence rate matches the lower bounds of stochastic first-order optimizers with respect to both the initial function value and final error. In contrast, there exist cases where SGDM fails to converge regardless of hyperparameters. This separates the convergence properties of Adam and SGDM.

4. It introduces a novel stopping-time based technique to show that the minimum gradient norm during Adam's iterations can match the lower bounds across all problem hyperparameters. This technique also helps prove Adam with a specific scheduler is parameter-agnostic.

In summary, the main contribution is using theoretical analysis to clearly separate Adam and SGDM in terms of their convergence guarantees under non-uniform smoothness, in both deterministic and stochastic settings. The results reveal advantages of Adam that distinguish it from SGDM.

The paper aims to clearly distinguish between the convergence rates of the Adam optimizer and SGDM under the condition of non-uniform smoothness. It proves that Adam can achieve faster convergence compared to SGDM in both deterministic and stochastic settings. 

The key contributions include:

- Proving Adam matches known lower bounds on convergence rates in deterministic settings, whereas GDM does not

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel Lyapunov function for analyzing the convergence of deterministic Adam. How does this Lyapunov function differ from ones used in prior work? What motivated the specific form proposed here?

2. When bounding the convergence rate of stochastic Adam, the authors employ a two-stage divide-and-conquer approach to control the adaptive learning rate. Can you explain the key ideas behind this technique and why it was needed? 

3. The paper proves parameter-agnostic convergence for Adam with a specific scheduler. What is the intuition behind the scheduler choice? Can you think of alternatives that may also lead to similar guarantees?

4. The stopping time technique is an interesting idea introduced in the paper. In what scenarios is this likely to help tighten the convergence rate bounds? Are there any limitations or downsides to this approach?  

5. How does the paper address challenges with maintaining closed-form expressions for expected values when conditioning on certain gradient norm thresholds across iterations? 

6. When lower bounding the convergence rate of gradient descent with momentum (GDM), the paper constructs a counterexample to handle large momentum coefficients. Explain the intuition behind why large momentum can impede optimization in this case.

7. For the SGD lower bound, the paper makes an observation about how sharp growth in objectives can effectively convert noise into a heavy-tailed distribution. Elaborate on this idea and discuss the implications.  

8. Compare and contrast the challenges faced in analyzing Adam under non-uniform smoothness versus standard smoothness assumptions. What new proof techniques did the paper require?

9. Could the parameter-agnostic proof technique be extended to establish similar results for other adaptive methods like AdaGrad and AdamNC? Why or why not?

10. The paper separates the convergence rates of Adam and SGD-M. Based on the analysis, what types of problems do you expect Adam to outperform SGD-M on in practice? When might the opposite occur?
