# [Not Just Change the Labels, Learn the Features: Watermarking Deep Neural   Networks with Multi-View Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10663)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) are being widely deployed using Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms. However, there is a risk of attackers stealing the functionality of DNN models using black-box attacks like model extraction. 

- Existing watermarking methods using trigger sets are still vulnerable to such functionality stealing attacks. The labels assigned to the trigger set often lack correlation with the actual image content, making it challenging to transfer predictions on the trigger set from the source model to a stolen surrogate model.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides a new perspective on trigger set-based watermarking based on feature learning. It shows that using multi-view data, which exhibits diverse features, as the trigger set can enable transferring predictions more effectively.

- A trigger set selection method is introduced to identify multi-view data from the source dataset based on logit margin loss. Samples close to the decision boundary tend to possess multi-view features.

- A feature regularization loss is added while training the source model to enhance learning of the features associated with the label assigned to each trigger set sample.

- Together, these enable the source model's predictions on the trigger set to be preserved even in a stolen surrogate model. Ownership can then be verified by checking if the surrogate model predicts the intended labels on the trigger set.

Main Contributions:

- Provides a new perspective on trigger set-based watermarking based on feature learning and transferability of predictions using multi-view trigger sets.

- Introduces an efficient trigger set selection method to identify multi-view data based on logit margin loss.

- Incorporates a feature regularization loss to enhance feature learning on the trigger set.

- Achieves superior defense against functionality stealing attacks compared to prior arts, even when attackers use entirely different surrogate datasets and architectures.

In summary, the paper presents an effective DNN watermarking approach called MAT based on using multi-view trigger sets. This facilitates ownership verification even after black-box model extraction attacks.
