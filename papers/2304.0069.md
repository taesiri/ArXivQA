# [On stochastic MPC formulations with closed-loop guarantees: Analysis and
  a unifying framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.0069)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Analyzing and contrasting two main approaches to stochastic MPC with closed-loop guarantees:
- Robust-stochastic MPC (RS-MPC), which uses robust techniques like constraint tightening to ensure recursive feasibility
- Indirect feedback stochastic MPC (IF-SMPC), which modifies the MPC algorithm itself to preserve feasibility

The paper provides a qualitative analysis to highlight limitations and advantages of each approach. 

2) Proposing a unifying stochastic MPC framework called multi-step stochastic MPC (MS-SMPC) that contains RS-MPC and IF-SMPC as special cases. This framework allows conditioning the chance constraints on states up to M steps in the past.

3) Providing numerical simulations to demonstrate cases where RS-MPC and IF-SMPC have complementary strengths/weaknesses, and showing how the proposed MS-SMPC can mitigate limitations of both approaches.

So in summary, the main research goals are:
- Contrasting two major SMPC frameworks through qualitative analysis and numerical study
- Developing a unifying SMPC formulation that encompasses both frameworks
- Demonstrating the advantages of the proposed formulation

The central hypothesis appears to be that explicitly bridging these two frameworks can provide flexibility and avoid limitations of using purely one approach or the other for stochastic MPC with guarantees.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Providing a qualitative comparison and analysis of two main stochastic MPC frameworks (robust techniques vs feasibility preserving algorithms) by considering specific representative MPC formulations (robust-stochastic MPC and indirect feedback stochastic MPC). The analysis highlights intrinsic limitations and trade-offs of the two approaches.

2. Deriving a novel unifying stochastic MPC framework called multi-step stochastic MPC that contains the two existing formulations as special cases. This allows trading off between their limitations.

3. Providing numerical simulations that demonstrate the complementary benefits and shortcomings of the two existing MPC formulations. The proposed multi-step MPC is shown to be able to avoid the pitfalls of both by suitable choice of its tuning parameter.

In summary, the key contributions are the qualitative analysis contrasting the two existing SMPC frameworks, the proposal of a unifying SMPC formulation, and supporting numerical studies. The analysis and new SMPC scheme aim to provide better understanding and design of stochastic MPC algorithms.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper investigates and compares stochastic model predictive control frameworks based on robust techniques versus feasibility preserving algorithms, highlights limitations of both approaches, and proposes a unified framework that encompasses these existing methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a nice analysis and comparison between two main approaches to stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) with closed-loop stability and constraint satisfaction guarantees. The two approaches analyzed are:

1) Robust-stochastic MPC (RS-MPC) which uses robust techniques like constraint tightening to ensure recursive feasibility. This includes methods like those in Cannon et al. 2010, Kouvaritakis & Cannon 2010, Lorenzen et al. 2017. 

2) Indirect feedback SMPC (IF-SMPC) which modifies the MPC algorithm itself to preserve feasibility, including approaches like Farina et al. 2013, 2015, 2016 and Hewing et al. 2018, 2020. 

The key contribution is providing both a qualitative analysis of the intrinsic limitations and trade-offs of each approach, as well as numerical simulations demonstrating cases where one method significantly outperforms the other. 

The qualitative analysis neatly summarizes the core differences between conditioning constraints on the current state (RS-MPC) versus the initial state (IF-SMPC), and how this leads to different conservatism as the probability levels change. The numerical studies clearly showcase the performance gaps in the edge cases.

The paper also proposes a unifying multi-step SMPC framework that contains both approaches as special cases, providing a tool to balance their limitations. Overall, this paper gives an excellent high-level view of the trade-offs between these two main SMPC approaches through both theoretical analysis and case studies.

The analysis is fairly self-contained, but fits well within the broader SMPC literature like Mesbah 2016, Farina et al. 2016, Kouvaritakis 2016 which aim to provide overviews and comparisons of SMPC techniques. The qualitative analysis provides new insights compared to prior work. Overall, this paper makes a nice contribution to better understanding the current SMPC landscape.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further investigating the proposed multi-step SMPC framework. The authors state this provides a natural basis for future work, as it unifies the two main existing SMPC approaches. Potential avenues could include analyzing theoretical properties, developing efficient methods to choose the multi-step horizon M, comparing to other recent SMPC algorithms, etc. 

- Considering chance input constraints in addition to state chance constraints. The authors note their setup considers hard input constraints, while many SMPC methods focus on chance constraints. Extending the analysis and frameworks to handle both types of chance constraints could be useful.

- Comparing the SMPC methods on further case studies and examples, especially problems motivated by real applications. The paper provides some initial numerical comparisons, but more extensive simulations could further demonstrate when each approach performs best.

- Extending the frameworks to handle more complex system dynamics and noise models beyond the linear systems with bounded noise considered here. For example, applying the techniques to nonlinear systems or systems with Gaussian noise.

- Incorporating data-driven methods to learn system models, constraint tightenings, terminal sets, etc. The authors note some recent work has explored data-driven SMPC, so combining this with the approaches studied could be promising.

- Analyzing the closed-loop performance of the SMPC schemes more formally using robust or stochastic control theory. The paper focuses on constraints satisfaction and recursive feasibility guarantees.

- Developing customized optimization methods to efficiently solve the SMPC formulations, as they lead to more complex QPs than standard MPC.

So in summary, the main directions are: further analysis of the unifying multi-step SMPC, extensions to more complex systems and constraints, incorporation of data-driven techniques, more formal performance analysis, and development of tailored optimization methods.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates and compares two main frameworks for stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) formulations that provide closed-loop guarantees: using robust techniques vs feasibility preserving algorithms. The authors first present and analyze two representative SMPC schemes - robust-stochastic MPC and indirect feedback SMPC - highlighting intrinsic limitations of both approaches. A qualitative analysis reveals cases where either formulation is guaranteed to be superior. This analysis is complemented by numerical simulations showcasing quantitative differences. Finally, the authors propose a novel SMPC framework called multi-step SMPC that naturally unifies these two existing formulations. The proposed scheme allows conditioning the chance constraints on a state up to M steps in the past, recovering the two existing schemes for M=1 and M=infinity. Overall, this paper provides new insights into the relationships and trade-offs between established SMPC frameworks through both theoretical analysis and numerical examples.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates model predictive control (MPC) formulations for linear systems subject to stochastic disturbances with bounded support and chance constraints. The paper focuses on comparing two main frameworks for stochastic MPC that provide recursive feasibility and constraint satisfaction: using robust techniques like constraint tightening versus modifying the MPC algorithm itself to be "feasibility preserving". 

The paper first presents two representative stochastic MPC formulations - a robust-stochastic MPC using primarily robust tightening and an indirect feedback MPC where the nominal trajectory is independent of disturbances. It provides a qualitative analysis of cases where each method performs poorly, highlighting limitations in different edge cases. To unify these approaches, the paper proposes a multi-step stochastic MPC that conditions chance constraints on a state up to M steps in the past, recovering the two methods for M=1 and M=infinity. This allows flexibly trading off their complementary benefits. Numerical simulations demonstrate significant performance differences between methods and the ability of the unifying multi-step MPC to navigate the tradeoff.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents an approach for stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) of linear systems subject to bounded stochastic disturbances and chance constraints. The key method is to develop an SMPC formulation that unifies two common SMPC frameworks:

1. Robust-stochastic MPC: This approach tightens the chance constraints in a robust manner to ensure recursive feasibility. Only the first disturbance is treated stochastically, while the rest of the horizon is handled robustly. 

2. Indirect feedback SMPC: Here the nominal state trajectory is independent of disturbances, which provides recursive feasibility. The chance constraints are enforced along this nominal trajectory using a pure stochastic tightening.

The proposed unifying SMPC conditions the chance constraints on a state up to M steps in the past, with M a design parameter. For M=1, this recovers robust-stochastic MPC, while M=infinity yields indirect feedback SMPC. By tuning M, the benefits of both frameworks can be leveraged. Theoretical guarantees and numerical examples demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach.

In summary, the key contribution is a unifying SMPC formulation that bridges two common SMPC frameworks through a multi-step formulation, providing flexibility and performance improvements.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing two main issues related to stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) for systems subject to bounded stochastic disturbances:

1. There are two main frameworks for SMPC that provide closed-loop guarantees on feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and performance: 

(a) Using robust techniques like constraint tightening to ensure recursive feasibility. This includes methods like robust-stochastic MPC.

(b) Using modified MPC algorithms that preserve feasibility like indirect feedback MPC. 

The paper provides a qualitative analysis comparing these two frameworks and highlighting limitations of each approach.

2. The paper proposes a unified SMPC framework called multi-step SMPC that contains the two existing frameworks as special cases and allows trading off their benefits.

In more detail:

- The two existing SMPC frameworks were developed somewhat independently for different problem setups. The paper provides the first direct comparison between them.

- The robust techniques can be conservative if the robust bounds are much more conservative than the chance constraints. The feasibility preserving methods are more conservative as the probability levels approach 1.

- The proposed multi-step SMPC conditions constraints on states up to M steps in the past and recovers the existing methods for M=1 or M=infinity. This allows flexibly trading off their limitations.

So in summary, the key contribution is providing both a qualitative analysis of limitations and tradeoffs of existing SMPC methods, as well as proposing a unifying SMPC framework that contains them as special cases. The numerical results demonstrate that the differences between methods can be practically significant.
