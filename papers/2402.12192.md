# [Pan-Mamba: Effective pan-sharpening with State Space Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12192)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Pan-sharpening is a technique to integrate the complementary information from low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) and high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) satellite images to generate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. This allows acquiring HRMS images that are otherwise difficult to directly obtain from satellites due to hardware constraints. Recently, deep learning methods have shown great success in this task compared to traditional methods. However, current deep learning methods have limitations in effectively capturing global context and long-range dependencies in the images.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel deep network called Pan-Mamba for pan-sharpening. The key idea is to leverage a State Space Model called Mamba which can effectively model long-range dependencies with linear complexity. The proposed Pan-Mamba network has three main components:

1) Mamba Blocks: Apply Mamba independently on LRMS and PAN features to extract global contexts from them.

2) Channel Swapping Mamba: Lightweight fusion by swapping and concatenating parts of LRMS and PAN features. Helps enrich feature diversity.

3) Cross-Modal Mamba: Projects LRMS and PAN features in a shared space and fuses them using gating mechanisms. Helps suppress redundant features while enhancing complementary ones.

Overall, Pan-Mamba facilitates efficient global feature extraction from individual modalities and cross-modal feature fusion.

Main Contributions:

- First work to introduce Mamba model for pan-sharpening to capture global context
- Proposed channel swapping Mamba and cross-modal Mamba for effective cross-modal interaction 
- Pan-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across datasets demonstrating better spectral and spatial quality

In summary, this paper explores the potential of Mamba models for pan-sharpening and shows state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance. The global modeling capability and efficient cross-modal fusion are the main strengths of the proposed Pan-Mamba network.
