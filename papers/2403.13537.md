# [What explains the success of cross-modal fine-tuning with ORCA?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13537)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
ORCA is a recent cross-modal fine-tuning technique that achieves high performance by training an embedder to map data into the embedding space of a pre-trained model before fine-tuning. However, it is unclear which components contribute to ORCA's success. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors perform several ablations on ORCA to analyze the individual contributions of its components on 2D and 1D tasks:

1. They find the choice of proxy dataset used for embedder training does not affect performance on 2D tasks and matters little for 1D. 

2. Contrary to claims in the original paper, more embedder training can hurt downstream performance, and is entirely unnecessary for some tasks. 

3. Freezing experiments show fine-tuning the pre-trained model itself is critical to performance, while the embedder need not be fine-tuned once trained.

4. For a simple 1D task, pre-training is unnecessary, highlighting the need for no-pretraining baselines.


Main Contributions:

- Better understanding of how the individual components of ORCA affect its cross-modal transfer capabilities. 

- Embedder training is less important than claimed, fine-tuning the model itself is critical.

- Highlights the need for careful ablations and baselines when evaluating cross-modal techniques to identify why they work.

In summary, the paper provides a more nuanced perspective on ORCAâ€™s success through ablation studies, emphasizing that model fine-tuning rather than embedder training is key for many tasks. The results demonstrate the importance of strong baselines and ablations for reliable evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper runs ablations on the ORCA cross-modal fine-tuning method and finds that embedder training helps 1D but not 2D tasks, more embedder training can hurt performance, fine-tuning the pretrained model is critical, and pretraining is unnecessary for simple tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper performs a series of ablations and experiments to better understand the individual components of ORCA, a recently proposed cross-modal fine-tuning method, and their contribution to its performance. Specifically, the authors find that:

- Embedder training does not help 2D tasks and can even hurt performance on 1D tasks, contrary to claims in the original ORCA paper. 

- Fine-tuning the pre-trained model is critical for good performance across tasks, while further fine-tuning the embedder after initial training is not necessary.  

- For a simple 1D task (Satellite dataset), using a pre-trained model is not even necessary, highlighting the need for no pre-training baselines.

In summary, through their analysis the authors show that model fine-tuning plays a bigger role in ORCA's performance than claimed originally, qualify the importance of embedder training, and contribute a more nuanced understanding of what enables effective cross-modal transfer with ORCA.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Cross-modal fine-tuning - Adapting pre-trained models to new modalities beyond their original training data
- ORCA - A recent cross-modal fine-tuning technique consisting of training an embedder and fine-tuning the embedder + model
- Embedder training - Training the custom embedder in ORCA to map target data into the model's embedding space
- Ablations - Experiments that remove or change components of a method to test their necessity 
- Proxy datasets - Stand-in datasets used for embedder training in ORCA
- Downstream performance - Performance of the adapted model on the actual target task
- Model fine-tuning - Fine-tuning the pre-trained model on the target task data
- Frozen components - Fixing parts of the model during fine-tuning
- Pre-training - Initial training of a model on a large dataset before adaptation
- Encoder-decoder models - Models with separate encoder and decoder components
- Encoder-only models - Models consisting of only an encoder, e.g. RoBERTa

The key concepts revolve around understanding the different components of ORCA and their contributions, which are analyzed through careful ablations. The choice of proxy dataset, embedder training, and model fine-tuning are evaluated, along with comparisons to baselines without pre-training.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors claim that embedder training is critical to ORCA's success, but the results seem to show otherwise for 2D tasks. Why do you think there is this discrepancy? What could explain the different effects of embedder training on 1D vs 2D tasks?

2. The choice of proxy dataset does not seem to affect downstream task performance, even using randomly generated fake data. What implications does this have on the theory behind using proxy datasets for embedder training? Are there alternative explanations for why they don't matter?

3. For some tasks, minimizing the OTDD metric during embedder training leads to worse downstream performance. How could the OTDD metric be improved or modified to better correlate with downstream performance across more tasks? 

4. Freezing the pre-trained model before fine-tuning severely hurts performance regardless of embedder training. Does this imply the adaptations made during fine-tuning are more specific to the downstream task rather than exploiting general knowledge? How could this hypothesis be tested?

5. For the Satellite task, even a randomly initialized model performs just as well as a pre-trained one after fine-tuning. What properties of this dataset might enable effective learning without relying on pre-training? How prevalent do you think such simple tasks are?

6. The amount of pre-training data affects downstream performance at certain scales but not others. What factors determine what amount of pre-training is sufficient? How could the sufficiency threshold be determined for a new dataset?

7. The authors use a convolutional embedder architecture and linear predictor architecture throughout. How critical are these architectural choices to ORCA's performance? What alternate architectures could be effective?

8. ORCA relies on supervised fine-tuning data. Could an unsupervised variant work by instead continuing pre-training on unlabeled target data before fine-tuning? What challenges would this introduce?

9. The paper analyzes cross-modal transfer from language to other modalities. Do you think the conclusions would generalize to other source modalities like vision as well? What differences might emerge?

10. The authors focus on analyzing embeddings, models, and predictors. How might changes to the attention mechanism or self-attention layers impact ORCA's cross-modal transfer abilities? Are attention layers equally important across modalities?
