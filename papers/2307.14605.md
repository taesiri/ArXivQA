# [Clustering based Point Cloud Representation Learning for 3D Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14605)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we learn an appropriate point embedding space for point cloud analysis that is aware of both discriminative semantics and challenging variations caused by depth, viewpoint, occlusion, etc?The key points are:- Point cloud analysis (e.g. segmentation, detection) is challenging due to the irregular geometry of point clouds as well as variations caused by depth, occlusion, viewpoint, etc. - Existing methods focus on adapting neural networks to the geometry of point clouds, but do not address how to learn good point embeddings aware of semantics and robust to variations.- The paper proposes a clustering-based supervised learning scheme to learn point embeddings that capture fine-grained latent patterns across scenes to be more discriminative and robust.So in summary, the central question is how to learn point embeddings that are discriminative for semantics yet robust to variations, which the paper addresses through a novel clustering-based supervised learning approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The key contributions of this paper are:- It proposes a clustering based supervised learning scheme for point cloud analysis, particularly 3D segmentation. The core idea is to leverage unsupervised clustering and regularization of the feature space to complement standard supervised learning of point-wise classification.- It introduces an online clustering method based on optimal transport solved via Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. This allows for efficient discovery of latent subclass patterns within each semantic class across training scenes. - It presents two cluster analysis based contrastive losses, point-point and point-center, that explicitly shape the point embedding space using the discovered subclasses. This imposes structures and shapes the feature space to be discriminative and robust.- The overall training framework integrates standard cross-entropy loss with the proposed clustering analysis losses. It alternates between within-class clustering and optimization of the segmentation network with both semantic labels and cluster assignments.- The method is shown to bring consistent and notable gains over various backbone networks on major 3D segmentation benchmarks. It also demonstrates utility for 3D detection, proving its general applicability.In summary, the key contribution is a principled clustering based supervised learning scheme for point cloud analysis that discovers and leverages latent data structures to aid representation learning and recognition. The integration of unsupervised clustering with supervised classification is novel for point cloud segmentation.
