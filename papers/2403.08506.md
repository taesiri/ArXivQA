# [DiPrompT: Disentangled Prompt Tuning for Multiple Latent Domain   Generalization in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08506)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most federated learning (FL) methods for domain generalization assume a one-to-one mapping between clients and source domains. This becomes impractical when the number of clients significantly exceeds source domains, as data from a domain can be dispersed across multiple clients. Learning invariant features across all clients is challenging in this scenario. Moreover, existing methods rely on domain labels, which may not be available and risks privacy leakage.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Disentangled Prompt Tuning (DiPrompT) for domain generalization in federated learning without requiring domain labels. The key ideas are:

1) Disentangled prompt learning to separately extract domain-invariant and domain-specific knowledge using two prompts:
   - Global prompt (G-Prompt) captures knowledge invariant across all clients  
   - Domain prompts (D-Prompts) capture valuable domain-specific knowledge

2) Dynamic query mechanism to automatically predict the domain label for each sample at training and inference time using a query prompt (Q-Prompt).

3) Collaborative ensemble to effectively exploit the complementary knowledge in G-Prompt and D-Prompts for better generalization on target domains.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel federated domain generalization framework DiPrompT using prompt tuning without needing one-to-one client-domain mapping or domain labels
- Introduces disentangled prompt learning to extract invariant and specific knowledge from decentralized data 
- Designs a dynamic query mechanism for latent domain generalization based on image-text alignment
- Achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets

In summary, DiPrompT provides an efficient and lightweight approach to tackle key practical restrictions in federated domain generalization via adaptive prompt tuning. Experiments verify its effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel federated learning framework called Disentangled Prompt Tuning (DiPrompT) that learns complementary general and domain-specific knowledge through prompt tuning to achieve superior domain generalization performance without requiring one-to-one mapping between clients and domains or domain labels during training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes DiPrompT, a novel federated domain generalization framework based on prompt tuning. It is the first attempt to introduce prompt tuning for domain generalization in federated learning settings.

2. DiPrompT aims to learn both general knowledge shared across clients as well as valuable specific information from different domains/clients. This provides complementary knowledge to improve performance on unseen target domains, especially when the number of clients exceeds the number of domains. 

3. DiPrompT removes two impractical restrictions of prior federated domain generalization methods: (1) the strict one-to-one mapping between clients and domains, (2) the requirement of domain labels during training.

4. An adaptive query mechanism based on prompt tuning is introduced to automatically predict the domain label for each sample when not given, by image-text alignment.

5. Extensive experiments verify DiPrompT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, even surpassing some centralized domain generalization methods that utilize domain labels.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an efficient and robust federated domain generalization approach using prompt tuning, which provides complementary knowledge and removes restrictions for better generalization ability.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Federated learning (FL): A distributed machine learning approach that enables training models across decentralized edge devices or servers while keeping data localized.

- Domain generalization (DG): The task of learning a model on multiple source domains that can generalize well to unseen target domains.

- Disentangled prompt tuning (DiPrompT): The proposed method in the paper that introduces prompt tuning for domain generalization in federated learning. Includes global prompt (G-Prompt), domain prompts (D-Prompts), and query prompt (Q-Prompt).

- Global prompt: Learns domain-invariant representations shared across all clients/devices. 

- Domain prompts: Learns domain-specific knowledge from different source domains via prototypical prompts.

- Query prompt: Automatically determines the suitable domain prompt for each sample by image-text alignment.

- Collaborative ensemble: Dynamically ensembles predictions from global and domain-specific prompts at test time.

- Latent domain generalization: Domain labels are unknown for local client data during training.

So in summary, the key concepts are around using prompt tuning to extract both generic and domain-specific knowledge in federated learning for domain generalization, without needing explicit domain labels. The prompts are disentangled and collaboratively assembled to improve generalization.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes disentangled prompt tuning to handle domain generalization in federated learning. What is the intuition behind using disentangled prompts rather than a single shared prompt? How do the global and domain-specific prompts complement each other?

2. Explain the domain prompt aggregation strategy in detail. Why is it needed when the number of clients exceeds the number of domains? How does it help resolve the issue of imbalanced contributions across domains/clients? 

3. What is the motivation behind using a two-substep strategy (first classify category, then predict domain) in the dynamic query scheme? How does this avoid interference from semantic category labels?

4. What is the purpose of using self-consistent regularization terms $L_{mse}$ and $L_{KL}$ during query prompt optimization? How do they ensure better adaptation of the prompt to downstream tasks?

5. The collaborative ensemble process combines knowledge from global and domain-specific prompts. Explain the formulation of the dynamic weights $w_m$ and $w_g$. Why is a weighted combination better than simply averaging prompts?

6. How does the proposed method eliminate restrictions on one-to-one mapping between clients and domains? What makes it more flexible for practical federated learning scenarios?

7. The experiments show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods even without using domain labels. Analyze the possible reasons that contribute to this significant improvement.

8. The ablation study examines several component removals such as no global prompt, no domain prompts etc. Analyze the performance drop in each case to understand the contribution of individual components.  

9. Study the impact of key hyperparameters such as number of clients and loss weight coefficient. How do they affect overall performance? What are the optimal values?

10. Critically analyze the limitations of the current approach. What additions/modifications can be made to further improve its applicability and effectiveness for federated domain generalization?
