# [4D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Dynamic Scene Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08528)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we achieve real-time rendering for dynamic scenes at high resolutions while maintaining high quality?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D-GS) representation to model dynamic scenes. 

- It introduces an efficient deformation field to model both Gaussian motions and shape deformations over time.

- This allows real-time rendering of dynamic scenes at high resolutions by transforming canonical 3D Gaussians to represent the scene at each timestep.

- The deformation field connects adjacent Gaussians via a HexPlane representation to enable more accurate motion and shape deformation modeling.

- Experiments show 4D-GS can achieve real-time rendering on dynamic scenes (e.g. 70 FPS at 800x800 resolution) while maintaining quality comparable or better than prior state-of-the-art methods.

So in summary, the main research question is how to achieve real-time, high quality rendering of dynamic scenes, which 4D-GS aims to address through its efficient scene representation and deformation modeling approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D-GS), an efficient method to achieve real-time rendering of dynamic scenes while maintaining high quality. The key ideas are:

- Representing the scene with 3D Gaussians and modeling their motions and shape changes over time using a compact deformation field instead of separate Gaussians per timestamp. This allows efficient storage and training. 

- The deformation field uses a multi-resolution HexPlane structure to capture relationships between nearby Gaussians spatially and temporally, enabling accurate motion and shape modeling. 

- Rendering is done by differentiable splatting of the deformed Gaussians, which is much faster than volume rendering used in other dynamic scene methods.

In summary, 4D-GS achieves real-time rendering speeds of up to 70 FPS at 800x800 resolution while having comparable or higher rendering quality than previous state-of-the-art dynamic scene methods. The compact representation also enables efficient training and storage. The method represents an effective way to achieve real-time high-quality rendering of dynamic scenes.
