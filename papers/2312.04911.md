# [Collinear datasets augmentation using Procrustes validation sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04911)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new data augmentation method for numeric and mixed datasets that leverages collinearity, specifically for use in training machine learning models like artificial neural networks (ANNs). The method generates additional synthesized data points by fitting the training data to a latent variable model using either singular value decomposition (SVD) or partial least squares (PLS) decomposition. It then introduces sampling error to the fitted model's orientation vectors by applying cross-validation resampling. This creates new predictor datasets (called PV-sets) with similar covariance structure to the original data, but with unique values. Experiments on near infrared spectra for predicting meat protein content and clinical heart disease data for classification show clear improvements in ANN model performance when augmenting the training set with PV-sets, reducing error substantially. The method has few parameters and does not require much tuning. It is fast, simple, and versatile for many data types and analysis tasks dealing with collinear data. The authors provide open-source implementations to enable use and reproducibility. Overall, it is an effective way to generate additional training samples for complex models in data-scarce conditions.
