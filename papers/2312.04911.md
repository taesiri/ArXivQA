# [Collinear datasets augmentation using Procrustes validation sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04911)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Many modern machine learning methods like neural networks require large amounts of training data, but often only limited data is available. This can lead to overfitting and lack of reproducibility. 
- Existing data augmentation techniques for numeric/mixed collinear datasets are limited, often relying just on adding noise. More sophisticated methods require complex neural network models for generation.
- There is a need for a simple, fast data augmentation approach suitable for numeric/mixed collinear data that directly leverages the collinearity structure.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a data augmentation method based on Procrustes cross-validation that generates new data points by introducing sampling variation measured via cross-validation into a dataset.
- Two implementations are provided using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) to model the data and prioritize different parts of the covariance structure.
- The method splits data using cross-validation, trains models on splits, measures orientation variation between global and local models, and introduces that variation into the data to emulate sampling error.
- It has very few parameters (number of latent variables, number of splits) that generally don't need specific tuning.

Contributions:
- Provides a simple, fast, versatile data augmentation approach suitable for numeric/mixed collinear data.
- Significantly improved performance of neural network models on two real-world case studies - prediction of protein content and patient disease classification. 
- Reduced model error by 1.5-3x on protein prediction and increased classification accuracy from 0.5 to 0.84-0.91 on patient data through augmentation.
- Showed parameters have little effect, with number of augmented datasets the main driver of improved performance.
- Implemented in multiple languages and provides an online browser-based version.

In summary, it proposes a novel data augmentation technique for collinear data that leverages cross-validation and latent variable modeling to emulate sampling variation. It demonstrated clear improvements in model performance on real-world data with negligible parameter tuning.
