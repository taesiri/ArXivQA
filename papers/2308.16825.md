# [Coarse-to-Fine Amodal Segmentation with Shape Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16825)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve amodal segmentation by generating amodal masks in a coarse-to-fine manner? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Amodal segmentation can be improved by first generating a coarse amodal mask capturing overall shape, and then refining it with more details. This coarse-to-fine approach can complement strengths of different model architectures. 2) Transformers are well-suited for generating coarse amodal masks by learning shape priors in a vector-quantized latent space. Their ability to capture long-range dependencies can aid in perceiving overall shape from limited visible cues.3) Convolutional networks are effective at refining the coarse masks by incorporating fine-grained visual features and details. They can inject information missing from the coarse stage.4) Modeling amodal segmentation as mask prediction and iterative completion, as done in BERT and MaskGIT, allows learning shape priors and decoding amodal masks sequentially.5) The framework can generalize to video amodal segmentation by extending the transformer architecture to model spatio-temporal features across frames.In summary, the key hypothesis is that a coarse-to-fine approach using transformers and CNNs can improve amodal segmentation by combining their complementary strengths through shape priors and visual feature refinement. The method is applicable to both images and videos.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing a novel coarse-to-fine framework called C2F-Seg for amodal segmentation. The framework uses transformers to learn shape priors in a vector quantized latent space and generate coarse masks. It then refines the coarse masks using a convolutional module to inject fine details. - Introducing a new synthetic dataset called MOViD-A for video amodal segmentation. This dataset contains 838 videos with 12,299 annotated objects.- Achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for both image and video amodal segmentation. The method outperforms prior work on KINS, COCOA, FISHBOWL, and the new MOViD-A dataset.- Demonstrating that the framework can effectively handle long-range dependencies, learn object priors, and refine details in a coarse-to-fine manner for amodal segmentation. The qualitative results show improved segmentation of occluded regions.- Showing the potential of the method to generalize to video-based amodal segmentation by extending it with spatio-temporal transformers. The model performs well even when objects are fully occluded.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new coarse-to-fine framework for amodal segmentation that combines strengths of transformers and convolutions to effectively leverage shape priors and refine details. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.
