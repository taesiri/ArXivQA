# [Guided Depth Super-Resolution by Deep Anisotropic Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11592)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:

How can guided anisotropic diffusion and deep learning be effectively combined into an integrated framework for guided depth super-resolution, leveraging the strengths of both approaches?

The key points are:

- Guided anisotropic diffusion provides an optimization framework for super-resolution that ensures adherence to the source depth values and sharp edges. 

- Deep learning can provide superior high-level feature representations to inform the diffusion process.

- By training a deep feature extractor end-to-end, gradients can be backpropagated through the diffusion process to learn optimal diffusion coefficients. 

- This hybrid approach aims to achieve state-of-the-art depth super-resolution results by integrating the benefits of optimization-based diffusion and data-driven deep feature learning.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that combining guided anisotropic diffusion and deep learning in an end-to-end trainable framework will lead to improved performance in guided depth super-resolution compared to either approach alone. The experiments aimed to validate this hypothesis.
