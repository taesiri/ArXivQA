# [InteractDiffusion: Interaction Control in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05849)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "InteractDiffusion: Interaction Control in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models":

Problem:
- Existing text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models like Stable Diffusion can generate high-quality images from textual descriptions, but lack control over the interactions between objects in the generated images. This is an important gap as controlling interactions could enable applications like generating realistic scenes with interacting characters. 

- The paper identifies three main challenges in interaction-conditioned image generation: (a) Representing interaction information meaningfully; (b) Modeling the complex relationships between multiple interactions; (c) Integrating interaction control into existing high-quality T2I models without hindering performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes InteractDiffusion, a pluggable interaction control module for existing T2I diffusion models. It takes as input interaction triplets (person, action, object) with bounding boxes and generates images conditioning on both text and interactions.

- Key ideas:
  - Tokenize interaction triplets into meaningful subject, action and object tokens containing localization and type information.
  - Model relationships between tokens via instance and role embeddings.
  - Add Interaction Self-Attention layer between the self-attention and cross-attention layers of T2I model transformers to incorporate interaction tokens.

- Together, these components form an Interaction Module that can be seamlessly integrated into T2I models to impose interaction control over generation process.

Main Contributions:  
- First work to introduce interaction control into diffusion models.
- Novel method of tokenizing and embedding interaction triplets to capture complex relationships. 
- Pluggable Interaction Module that integrates with existing models.
- Significantly outperforms baselines in controllability metrics without compromising on image quality.

The proposed interaction modeling framework enhances both the precision and capacity of interaction generation in T2I diffusion models. The strong quantitative and qualitative results validate its effectiveness.
