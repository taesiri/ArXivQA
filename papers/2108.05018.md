# [Are Neural Ranking Models Robust?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05018)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

Are neural ranking models robust?

To answer this question, the authors propose analyzing neural ranking model robustness from three perspectives:

1) Performance variance under I.I.D. settings: Analyzing the variance of ranking performance across different queries under the assumption that train and test data are drawn from the same distribution.

2) Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability: Analyzing how well models generalize when test data is drawn from a different distribution than the training data. 

3) Defensive ability against adversarial attacks: Analyzing model robustness when queries or documents are manipulated by an adversary aiming to fool the model.

The authors conduct experiments analyzing neural ranking models like DRMM, Conv-KNRM, Duet, BERT, and ColBERT from these three perspectives. They compare the robustness of these neural models to traditional probabilistic models like BM25 and language models, as well as learning to rank (LTR) models. 

The main research question is assessing whether neural ranking models are robust across these different definitions of robustness in information retrieval. The paper aims to provide a comprehensive robustness analysis to shed light on this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a comprehensive analysis of the robustness of neural ranking models compared to traditional probabilistic ranking models and learning to rank (LTR) models. Specifically:

- The paper proposes a taxonomy to define ranking model robustness from three perspectives: performance variance under I.I.D. settings, out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability, and defensive ability against adversarial attacks. 

- The paper designs experiments and metrics to evaluate model robustness based on this taxonomy. Experiments are conducted on several standard IR datasets.

- The paper analyzes the robustness of several representative neural ranking models, including representation-focused models like DSSM, interaction-focused models like DRMM and Conv-KNRM, hybrid models like Duet, and pretrained models like BERT. 

- The results show that in general, neural ranking models are less robust than traditional probabilistic and LTR models. However, pretrained models show superior robustness in terms of performance variance, while some neural models like DSSM and Duet are more robust to query attacks.

- The analysis provides insights into designing more robust neural ranking models, such as using character-level operations and novel pretraining objectives.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive study and analysis of neural ranking model robustness using a multi-dimensional definition. The empirical methodology and findings pave the way for developing more robust neural ranking models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a taxonomy to define ranking model robustness in information retrieval from three perspectives - performance variance, out-of-distribution generalizability, and defensive ability against adversarial attacks - and conducts experiments showing that neural ranking models are generally less robust than traditional probabilistic and learning-to-rank models, with some exceptions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to other research in evaluating the robustness of ranking models in information retrieval:

- The paper provides a comprehensive taxonomy for defining robustness of ranking models from three key perspectives - performance variance, out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability, and defensive ability against adversarial attacks. This provides a more structured way to analyze robustness compared to prior work which often looked at robustness dimensions in isolation.

- For performance variance, the paper builds on previous work that analyzed variance across queries. It proposes a new metric called VNAP to eliminate the influence of mean performance differences when comparing variance across models. 

- For OOD generalizability, the paper introduces two new datasets for evaluating on unforeseen query types and corpus. It also proposes a new metric called drop rate to quantify change in performance on OOD data. This provides a more rigorous way to measure OOD generalization. 

- For adversarial attacks, the paper explores both query and document attacks. For query attacks, it introduces new multi-level character and word edits. For document attacks, it follows previous work using the ASRC dataset. Overall, this provides a comprehensive analysis of defensive ability.

- In terms of models analyzed, the paper compares a wide range of traditional, learning-to-rank, and neural ranking models. This provides useful insights into the relative robustness across different model families. 

- The analysis shows neural ranking models are generally less robust compared to traditional models, while pretrained models demonstrate some robustness advantages. This highlights important directions for improving neural model robustness.

Overall, the paper provides one of the most extensive analyses on ranking model robustness done to date across multiple dimensions. The benchmark datasets, metrics, and model analysis offer a strong foundation for future research on improving robustness.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on the analysis and findings in their paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

1. Apply the findings on ranking robustness to improve existing ranking models. For example, incorporate character-level operations or pre-training objectives that have shown increased robustness in certain scenarios.

2. Design new robust neural ranking models based on the findings. For instance, explore novel pre-training objectives and model architectures tailored for IR that can enhance ranking robustness. 

3. Devise a unified formulation to analyze ranking models from different robustness perspectives in an integrated manner. For example, combine metrics like performance variance, OOD generalizability, and defensive ability into a single robustness measure.

4. Conduct more analysis on what factors specifically make neural ranking models less robust than traditional models, and how to mitigate those weaknesses. Areas to explore could include model complexity, regularization, training data diversity, etc.

5. Extend the robustness analysis to other neural ranking models and architectures beyond those studied in the paper.

6. Build more benchmark datasets and robustness tests to facilitate future study of ranking model robustness.

In summary, the main future directions are to utilize the robustness findings to improve existing models, design new robust models, unify the evaluation, understand causes of fragility, broaden the scope of analysis, and construct more resources. More research is needed to develop truly robust neural ranking models for real-world IR applications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper systematically analyzes the robustness of several representative neural ranking models against traditional probabilistic ranking models and learning to rank (LTR) models. The authors propose three ways to define robustness: performance variance under I.I.D. settings, out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability, and defensive ability against adversarial operations. Experiments are conducted on benchmark IR datasets to evaluate the different definitions of robustness. The results show that neural ranking models are generally less robust compared to other IR models on most robustness tasks, with some exceptions. For example, pre-trained models exhibit the best robustness from the perspective of performance variance, while some neural models like DSSM, Duet and Conv-KNRM show robustness in defending against query attacks.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper analyzes the robustness of neural ranking models compared to traditional probabilistic ranking models and learning-to-rank (LTR) models. The authors propose evaluating robustness in three ways: performance variance under i.i.d. settings, out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability, and defensive ability against adversarial attacks. For performance variance, they find that pre-trained models like BERT exhibit the lowest variance. For OOD generalizability, traditional probabilistic models and LTR models tend to outperform neural models when tested on new query types or corpora. For adversarial attacks, some neural models like DSSM and Duet show robustness against query typos, but overall neural models tend to be less robust than traditional models against document manipulation attacks. 

In conclusion, the results show neural ranking models are generally less robust than traditional IR models, with some exceptions. The analysis provides insight into strengths and weaknesses of different model types, and suggests future work on developing more robust neural ranking models. The proposed taxonomy for evaluating robustness and the empirical methodology are valuable contributions that can guide future research. Key findings are that pre-training helps variance, simple models help OOD generalizability, and character-level models help defend against typos.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a systematic analysis of the robustness of neural ranking models compared to traditional probabilistic ranking models and learning to rank (LTR) models. The key method is as follows:

The authors first propose three ways to define robustness of ranking models: 1) performance variance under I.I.D. settings; 2) out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability; and 3) defensive ability against adversarial operations. Based on these definitions, they construct corresponding benchmark datasets and propose metrics to evaluate each type of robustness. Specifically, they use variance of normalized average precision (VNAP) to measure performance variance; use drop rate (DR) to measure OOD generalizability on unseen query types or corpus; and use top change (TC), Kendall's tau (KT) distance and another DR to measure defensive ability against query attacks or document manipulation. With these datasets and metrics, they systematically compare the robustness of several representative neural ranking models (e.g. DRMM, Duet, BERT) against traditional probabilistic models (e.g. QL, BM25) and LTR models (e.g. RankSVM, LambdaMART). The results show that neural models are generally less robust than other models, with some exceptions like pre-trained models being most robust in terms of performance variance.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the question of whether neural ranking models for information retrieval (IR) are robust. The key points are:

- The paper defines robustness of ranking models in IR along three dimensions: 

1) Performance variance under I.I.D. settings: This refers to the variance in performance across queries, rather than just average performance. The metric used is variance of normalized average precision (VNAP).

2) Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability: This refers to how well models transfer when the train and test distributions are different, either due to different query types or different text corpora. The metric used is drop rate (DR). 

3) Defensive ability against adversarial operations: This refers to model performance when queries or documents are adversarially attacked. The metrics are drop rate for queries (DR_query) and top change/Kendall's tau distance for documents.

- Experiments were conducted with several neural ranking models (DSSM, DRMM, Conv-KNRM, Duet, BERT, ColBERT) compared to probabilistic models (QL, BM25) and learning-to-rank models (RankSVM, LambdaMART).

- Overall neural models did not perform well on robustness compared to other models, with some exceptions. Pre-trained models like BERT showed best performance variance. DSSM, Duet, Conv-KNRM showed defensive ability against query attacks.

- The paper concludes more research is needed to develop robust neural ranking models, perhaps via new pre-training objectives or model architectures. The analysis provides a foundation to design more robust models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a taxonomy to define robustness of ranking models from three perspectives - performance variance, out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability, and defensive ability against adversarial operations. How does this taxonomy provide a more comprehensive analysis of robustness compared to prior work?

2. The paper evaluates performance variance by analyzing poorly performing queries using metrics like percentage of queries with no relevant documents in top 10 retrieved (%no) and geometric mean average precision (gMAP). How suitable are these metrics to evaluate worst-case performance across queries? Could other metrics like tail latency be more informative?

3. For evaluating OOD generalizability, the paper uses a drop rate (DR) metric to measure performance difference between in-distribution and OOD examples. How does this metric compare to other distribution divergence measures like maximum mean discrepancy? Are there limitations to using a simple difference-based metric?

4. The paper evaluates defensive ability against query attacks using character and word-level perturbations. How comprehensive is this set of perturbations in representing real-world noisy queries? Could semantic perturbations like paraphrasing also be relevant? 

5. For document manipulation, the paper uses top change and Kendall's tau metrics to measure change in rankings. Do these capture all aspects of how rankings could change adversarially? Could other metrics like average rank change be useful?

6. The ranking models evaluated seem standard, but could more recent neural models using pre-training like REALM, ANCE, and RocketQA offer different robustness trade-offs?

7. The paper finds neural models are generally less robust than traditional IR models. Is this an intrinsic property of neural models or could changes in training methodology like adversarial training improve robustness?

8. How does the complexity vs robustness tradeoff observed compare to similar tradeoffs in other domains like computer vision? Are there useful parallels to be drawn?

9. For query attacks, DSSM and Duet show greater robustness due to use of character n-grams. How suitable is this technique for languages like Chinese which are non-alphabetic?

10. The paper provides useful insights into model robustness, but are the findings extensible to real-world search engines which use ensembles and blending? Could ensemble diversity provide robustness?
