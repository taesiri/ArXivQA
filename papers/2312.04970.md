## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a dataset generation pipeline using CARLA and AVstack. What are some key advantages of using simulation compared to a physical testbed for generating multi-agent autonomy datasets? What are some potential drawbacks or limitations?

2. The paper demonstrates a novel method for determining object visibility and occlusion using depth images. Can you explain the algorithm for computing the occlusion ratio in more detail? How is the computed ratio used to assign occlusion categories? 

3. The paper argues application-specific perception models are important for infrastructure sensing. Why does a camera-based model trained only on vehicle data fail when tested on infrastructure data? Would you expect the same issue for LiDAR-based perception?

4. The paper introduces a track-to-track fusion method using covariance intersection. Explain how covariance intersection works and why it is useful for handling unknown correlations in a decentralized sensor network. What assumptions does it make?

5. How does the framework proposed in the paper for multi-agent autonomy case studies differ from previous works like OPV2V? What practical considerations motivate designing more complex sensor network topologies?  

6. The paper finds post-tracking fusion outperforms fusion at the tracking level when there are intra-network correlations. Intuitively explain this result. How could the tracking-level fusion be improved?

7. The framework generates multiple complementary sensor modalities like cameras, LiDAR and radar. What are the relative advantages and limitations of each sensing type? How could they be fused effectively?

8. The paper uses a chain-of-command system to handle reference frame transformations. What challenges arise in aligning multi-agent coordinate systems? Why is this important?

9. Scenario configuration in simulation allows collecting interesting events like crashes that are rare in real-world data. What other configurable scenarios could be useful for multi-agent testing?

10. The pipeline proposed generates orders of magnitude more labeled multi-agent data than existing benchmarks like nuScenes or Waymo. What new research directions does having large-scale multi-agent data enable? What are remaining key bottlenecks?
