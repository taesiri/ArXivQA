# [Datasets, Models, and Algorithms for Multi-Sensor, Multi-agent Autonomy   Using AVstack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04970)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new framework for multi-sensor, multi-agent autonomy research leveraging the AVstack platform and CARLA simulator. The key innovations are: (1) a pipeline for generating unlimited volumes of labeled, multi-modal data from vehicles and infrastructure; (2) integration with perception models to enable application-specific training, with experiments showing infrastructure-trained models dramatically outperform vehicle-trained ones; and (3) multi-agent case studies comparing fusion approaches, finding post-tracking distributed data fusion handles unknown correlations best. Overall, this paper puts forth an end-to-end pipeline for multi-agent autonomy research, providing the first infrastructure-based dataset, showcasing the importance of application-specific models, and highlighting challenges in multi-agent fusion algorithms. The availability of this unified framework is poised to significantly advance the state of the art in collaborative autonomy.
