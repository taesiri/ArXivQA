# [VLUCI: Variational Learning of Unobserved Confounders for Counterfactual   Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.0904)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is how to estimate the distribution of unobserved confounders from observational data in order to improve the accuracy of counterfactual inference. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a new model called VLUCI (Variational Learning of Unobserved Confounders for Counterfactual Inference) to address the challenge of unobserved confounders in counterfactual inference. The presence of unobserved confounders can distort causal inferences, so the paper aims to quantify and infer the distribution of these unobserved confounders. 

The central hypothesis is that by disentangling the effects of observed and unobserved confounders using a doubly variational inference model, VLUCI can better estimate the distribution of unobserved confounders. This inferred distribution can then be incorporated into existing counterfactual inference models to improve their accuracy.

In summary, the key research question is how to estimate unobserved confounders for more accurate counterfactual inference, and the central hypothesis is that the proposed VLUCI model can achieve this through its novel doubly variational approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel variational learning model called VLUCI that relaxes the untestable unconfoundedness assumption in causal inference by inferring the distribution of unobserved confounders from observational data, which are shown through experiments to significantly improve counterfactual prediction accuracy when incorporated into existing methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research on counterfactual inference and unobserved confounders:

- Most prior work on counterfactual inference assumes "unconfoundedness", meaning there are no unobserved confounders. This paper directly addresses the problem of unobserved confounders, which distort causal inference in real-world observational data.

- Methods like CEVAE and GANITE have tried to model latent confounders, but rely on proxy variables to represent them. This paper models confounders independent of observed covariates, without requiring proxies.

- The proposed VLUCI model uses a variational autoencoder approach to explicitly infer the posterior distribution of unobserved confounders. This differs from other methods that try to balance representations or reweight samples to handle confounding.  

- VLUCI is designed to be compatible with other counterfactual inference methods by providing the estimated confounder distribution. Experiments show it improves accuracy of various state-of-the-art models.

- Most work focuses on accuracy metrics for counterfactual prediction. A unique aspect of VLUCI is providing confidence intervals for outcomes using the inferred confounders.

- The analysis on the IHDP dataset provides useful insights into interpreting what the inferred confounders may represent, even when assumptions are violated.

Overall, this paper makes important contributions towards handling the real-world problem of unobserved confounding in causal inference. The proposed techniques and experimental results advance the state of the art in this challenging subfield of machine learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring the actual implications of unobserved confounders generated by the VLUCI model in practical applications. The authors point out that the specific meaning of the inferred unobserved confounders should be understood in the context of analyzing the model's results and the actual data generation process. 

- Investigating other potential variables associated with the treatment or outcome that the VLUCI model may identify, beyond just unobserved confounders. As illustrated in their IHDP dataset experiment, the model generated a variable related to mother's skin color that provided insights into the underlying causal mechanism.

- Developing methods to provide confidence interval estimates for counterfactual outcomes using the inferred unobserved confounders. The authors mention this could aid decision-making in risk-sensitive application domains.

- Applying and evaluating the VLUCI model on more real-world observational datasets from various domains like healthcare, economics, etc. This could demonstrate its practical utility.

- Exploring modifications or extensions to the VLUCI framework to deal with scenarios where the causal assumptions do not strictly hold, while still leveraging its strengths.

- Comparing VLUCI against other methods for unobserved confounder inference and quantifying the improvements it provides.

- Investigating theoretical connections between the VLUCI model and instrumental variable techniques for dealing with unobserved confounding.

In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding the applications of VLUCI, testing its limits, and comparing it to other state-of-the-art methods to further demonstrate and improve its capabilities for counterfactual inference in the presence of unobserved confounders.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel variational learning model called VLUCI to estimate the distribution of unobserved confounders for more accurate counterfactual inference. It relaxes the unconfoundedness assumption made by many causal inference methods that there are no unobserved confounders. The model has three main components: 1) Prediction networks that estimate the direct causal effects of observed covariates on treatment and outcome variables; 2) A variational generator network that estimates the posterior distribution of unobserved confounders based on the treatment and outcome variables with covariate effects removed; 3) Reconstructor networks that reconstruct the treatment and outcome using the sampled unobserved confounders. Experiments on synthetic datasets show VLUCI can effectively recover unobserved confounders and improve counterfactual predictions of several state-of-the-art methods. The model is also applied to a semi-synthetic IHDP dataset, revealing its ability to infer meaningful hidden variables related to treatment selection. Overall, VLUCI provides a way to account for unobserved confounding beyond observed covariates to improve causal inference from observational data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes VLUCI, a novel variational learning model for estimating the distribution of unobserved confounders in observational data. Unobserved confounders are a major challenge in causal inference and counterfactual prediction, as they distort estimations of treatment effects. Most existing methods assume no unobserved confounders (unconfoundedness assumption), which is often unrealistic. VLUCI relaxes this assumption by inferring posterior distributions of confounders not captured in the observed covariates. It uses a doubly variational inference model with interacting reconstructions of the treatment and outcome to estimate confounder distributions. VLUCI disentangles observed covariates and unobserved confounders through partial regression, then runs inference on the residual treatment/outcome components. 

Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate VLUCI can accurately recover unobserved confounders. When used with existing counterfactual inference models, VLUCI substantially improves estimation accuracy of treatment effects. It provides confidence intervals to aid decision-making. The paper also analyzes results on a dataset that diverges from VLUCI's assumptions, showing the model can still provide useful insights about latent variables related to treatment/outcome. Key advantages are relaxing the unconfoundedness assumption and compatibility with state-of-the-art methods to enhance counterfactual prediction. Limitations include reliance on modeling assumptions and interpretability of inferred confounders. Overall, VLUCI is a promising approach for accounting for unobserved confounders in causal inference.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel variational learning model called VLUCI to estimate the distribution of unobserved confounders for improving counterfactual inference. The key ideas are:

1. Based on causal identifiability theory and partial regression, the paper proves that the direct causal effects of observed covariates on treatment and outcome can be estimated unbiasedly from observational data. This allows decomposing treatment and outcome into parts explained by covariates vs unobserved confounders. 

2. A variational generator network is developed to infer the posterior distribution of unobserved confounders based on the decomposed treatment and outcome variables. It uses a doubly reconstruction process to approximate the confounder distribution.

3. The estimated unobserved confounder distribution is then incorporated into existing counterfactual inference models like IPW, CFR, etc. to improve their accuracy by accounting for previously ignored confounding effects.

In summary, VLUCI relaxes the unconfoundedness assumption and estimates unobserved confounding effects through variational learning of the confounder distribution. Adding the learned confounders to counterfactual inference models significantly improves their prediction accuracy.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the problem of unobserved confounding in causal inference and counterfactual prediction from observational data. Specifically:

- Observational data often contains unobserved confounders that can distort causal inferences if not accounted for. Most existing methods make the untestable assumption of "unconfoundedness", i.e. no unobserved confounders. 

- The paper aims to relax this assumption by developing a method to estimate the posterior distribution of potential unobserved confounders from the observational data itself. 

- The estimated unobserved confounders can then be incorporated into existing counterfactual prediction models to improve their accuracy by accounting for confounding effects.

- The key research questions addressed are:

1) Can the direct causal effects of observed covariates be estimated in an unbiased way? (Lemma 1)

2) Can the distribution of unobserved confounders be accurately inferred? 

3) Does incorporating the estimated unobserved confounders improve counterfactual prediction accuracy of existing models?

4) What can be inferred about potential unobserved confounding even when the data doesn't strictly conform to the assumptions?

In summary, the paper focuses on quantifying and accounting for unobserved confounding to improve counterfactual causal inference from observational data.
