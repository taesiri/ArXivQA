# [VLUCI: Variational Learning of Unobserved Confounders for Counterfactual   Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.0904)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is how to estimate the distribution of unobserved confounders from observational data in order to improve the accuracy of counterfactual inference. Specifically, the paper proposes a new model called VLUCI (Variational Learning of Unobserved Confounders for Counterfactual Inference) to address the challenge of unobserved confounders in counterfactual inference. The presence of unobserved confounders can distort causal inferences, so the paper aims to quantify and infer the distribution of these unobserved confounders. The central hypothesis is that by disentangling the effects of observed and unobserved confounders using a doubly variational inference model, VLUCI can better estimate the distribution of unobserved confounders. This inferred distribution can then be incorporated into existing counterfactual inference models to improve their accuracy.In summary, the key research question is how to estimate unobserved confounders for more accurate counterfactual inference, and the central hypothesis is that the proposed VLUCI model can achieve this through its novel doubly variational approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel variational learning model called VLUCI to estimate the distribution of unobserved confounders for counterfactual inference. This helps relax the untestable unconfoundedness assumption made by many causal inference methods. 2. It provides a theoretical proof that the proposed method can unbiasedly estimate the direct causal effects of observed covariates on the treatment and outcome variables. 3. It develops a doubly variational inference model within VLUCI to disentangle observed and unobserved confounders and approximate the distribution of unobserved confounders.4. Through experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, it demonstrates that VLUCI can effectively infer unobserved confounders and significantly improve the accuracy of counterfactual inference when combined with existing methods.5. It provides an analysis of the practical considerations when applying VLUCI to real-world datasets where assumptions may not strictly hold, highlighting its practical utility.In summary, the key contribution is proposing VLUCI, a variational learning approach to inferring unobserved confounders and improving counterfactual inference under relaxed assumptions. The theoretical analysis, model development, and experimental results support the utility of this method.
