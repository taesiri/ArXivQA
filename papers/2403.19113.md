# [FACTOID: FACtual enTailment fOr hallucInation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19113)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT face the critical challenge of hallucination - generating factually incorrect responses. This is a major concern as adoption of LLMs grows.
- Existing textual entailment (TE) methods are inadequate for detecting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. They cannot accurately label text and identify the exact portions that contradict reality.

Proposed Solution - Factual Entailment:  
- Paper introduces a new type of TE called "Factual Entailment (FE)" that aims to detect factual inaccuracies in LLM-generated text while highlighting the specific contradicting span.
- Presents FACTOID, a benchmark dataset for FE containing 2 million text pairs across hallucination categories like imaginary figures, temporal issues etc.
- Proposes a multi-task learning framework for FE using state-of-the-art long text embeddings, GPT-3, SpanBERT and RoFormer.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces the concept of "Factual Entailment" as a way to detect hallucinations in LLM text.
- Creates FACTOID, a large-scale dataset to research factual entailment and hallucination detection.
- Proposes a multi-task learning model for factual entailment that outperforms state-of-the-art textual entailment methods. 
- Defines Automatic Hallucination Vulnerability Index (HVIauto) to quantify and compare tendency of different LLMs to hallucinate.
- Ranks 15 modern LLMs using HVIauto to showcase different hallucination tendencies.

The paper makes important strides in understanding and automatically detecting the critical issue of hallucinations in LLMs. Factual entailment and the FACTOID dataset open up new research avenues.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new type of textual entailment called Factual Entailment that aims to detect factual inaccuracies and hallucinations in language model generated text by combining entailment recognition, factual verification, and span detection to identify specific passages that contradict reality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing a new type of textual entailment called "Factual Entailment (FE)" that aims to detect factual inaccuracies in content generated by large language models while also highlighting the specific text span that contradicts reality.

2. Presenting $\mathcal{FACTOID}$, a benchmark dataset for factual entailment that contains 2 million text pairs for training and evaluating FE models.

3. Proposing a multi-task learning framework for factual entailment that incorporates state-of-the-art long text embeddings and models like GPT-3, SpanBERT, and RoFormer. This framework improves accuracy on the $\mathcal{FACTOID}$ benchmark by 30% compared to state-of-the-art textual entailment methods.

4. Assessing 15 modern large language models using the proposed Automated Hallucination Vulnerability Index ($HVI_{auto}$) to quantify and compare their likelihood of producing hallucinations.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing the concept of factual entailment and associated datasets and models to automatically detect hallucinations in large language model outputs.
