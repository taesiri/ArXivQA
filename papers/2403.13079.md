# [Current-Based Impedance Control for Interacting with Mobile Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13079)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
As robots transition from industrial settings to human-centered spaces, mobile manipulation and compliant control become important for safe and efficient operation. However, implementing compliant control on mobile manipulators poses challenges, especially when using off-the-shelf components without force/torque sensors. Typical impedance control requires torque sensors, while admittance control needs external force sensors. Thus the problem is how to achieve compliant control on mobile manipulators made of current-controlled manipulators and velocity-controlled bases, without adding sensors.

Proposed Solution:
1) A calibration method to estimate the torque/current ratio and friction of each joint, allowing impedance control on current-controlled arms without torque sensors. It uses gravity and the robot's model, also handling model errors. 

2) An operational space impedance controller for the compliant arm, with secondary tasks for redundancy.

3) A base controller that follows the end-effector, enabling two interaction modes:
   - Guidance mode: user leads robot by interacting with the arm 
   - Tracking mode: end-effector tracks target while allowing interactions

Main Contributions:
1) Calibration method for current/torque ratio and friction estimation that handles model inaccuracies, enabling sensorless current-based impedance control

2) Two operational modes for interacting with mobile manipulator through compliant arm

3) Experimental validation showing:
   - Consistency of calibration method
   - Performance of impedance control: 5mm tracking precision
   - Feasibility of operational modes for guiding and interacting with mobile manipulator

Overall, this paper presents a complete pipeline for sensorless compliant control on mobile manipulators, requiring only current control and standard positioning. This allows safe human-robot interaction without needing expensive sensing equipment. The real-world experiments showcase the practical applicability of this approach.
