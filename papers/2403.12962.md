# [FRESCO: Spatial-Temporal Correspondence for Zero-Shot Video Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12962)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Video manipulation poses unique challenges compared to images, especially in ensuring natural motion and temporal consistency across frames. While text-to-image diffusion models have seen great progress, extending them to video in a zero-shot manner without model training remains an open challenge. Prior zero-shot video translation methods rely predominantly on optical flow to guide inter-frame feature aggregation, but may suffer from inconsistency, undercoverage in occluded regions, and error accumulation over time.

Proposed Solution:
This paper presents FRamE Spatial-temporal COrrespondence (FRESCO), a novel zero-shot video translation framework that introduces both intra-frame spatial correspondence and inter-frame temporal correspondence as constraints. 

Key ideas:
1) Propose FRESCO-aware feature optimization to explicitly update U-Net decoder features towards consistency with input video using a spatial consistency loss and temporal consistency loss.
2) Introduce FRESCO-guided attention with three components - spatial-guided attention to aggregate features based on input self-similarity, efficient cross-frame attention, and temporal-guided attention along optical flow.
3) Translate long videos by heuristic keyframe selection and interpolation.

Main Contributions:
1) A robust zero-shot diffusion framework for coherent video translation using spatial-temporal correspondence constraints.
2) Combining FRESCO-guided attention and optimization as an effective intra- and inter-frame constraint with better coverage than optical flow alone.  
3) Long video translation methodology via joint frame processing and inter-batch consistency.

Experiments show the proposed method generates high-quality and temporally coherent video translations, outperforming state-of-the-art zero-shot approaches.
