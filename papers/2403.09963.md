# [Take Care of Your Prompt Bias! Investigating and Mitigating Prompt Bias   in Factual Knowledge Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09963)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent research shows that pre-trained language models (PLMs) suffer from "prompt bias" when used for factual knowledge extraction, meaning the prompts used to query the models tend to introduce biases towards certain answers. 
- However, the extent and impact of this prompt bias is not well understood. Specifically, it's unclear how different types of prompts exhibit bias and how much this bias impacts benchmark reliability and the models' actual knowledge retrieval capabilities.

Key Ideas and Contributions:

- The authors propose a method to quantify the inherent bias within different prompt types and PLMs. Experiments show all prompts have significant bias, with gradient-based prompts like AutoPrompt and OptiPrompt showing higher bias.

- They demonstrate two key negative impacts of prompt bias: 
   1) It can overfit and unreasonably amplify benchmark performance, especially on imbalanced datasets like LAMA.  
   2) It misleads models and impairs their capability to retrieve factual knowledge.

- They propose a representation-based debiasing approach that uses "prompt-only queries" to estimate the bias and subtracts this from the model's internal representations to get debiased outputs.

- Experiments show their debiasing approach can effectively correct inflated performance from prompt bias overfitting and consistently improve prompt retrieval capabilities across models and datasets.

- After debiasing, the performance of complex optimized prompts like OptiPrompt is comparable to simple manual prompts, indicating these prompts do not substantially improve knowledge retrieval vs. simply overfitting via bias.

To summarize, this paper provides novel insights into prompt bias in PLMs for factual knowledge probing, proposes an effective debiasing approach, and shows existing complex prompts have limited benefits once bias is accounted for. The findings can help build stronger and more reliable knowledge extraction from PLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates prompt bias in factual knowledge extraction from pre-trained language models, quantifies its negative impacts, and proposes a representation-based debiasing approach to mitigate it.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes three main contributions:

1. It proposes an approach to quantify the prompt bias in factual knowledge extraction for various prompts and PLMs. It shows that all prompts exhibit non-negligible bias, with gradient-based prompts displaying significantly higher levels. 

2. It demonstrates two negative impacts of prompt bias - overfitting benchmarks and misleading language models. It shows that prompt bias can unreasonably amplify benchmark performance through overfitting, especially on imbalanced datasets.

3. It proposes a representation-based debiasing approach to effectively mitigate prompt bias. Experiments show the approach can rectify inflated performance caused by overfitting and improves prompt retrieval capability. After debiasing, the performance of "better" prompts is comparable to vanilla manual prompts, shedding light on their actual retrieval capabilities.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a method to quantify, demonstrate the impact, and mitigate prompt bias in factual knowledge extraction from pre-trained language models. The debiasing approach enhances benchmark reliability and prompt retrieval capability.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Prompt bias - The unintended bias that prompts tend to introduce towards specific labels when used to probe factual knowledge from language models. A main concept explored in this paper.

- Factual knowledge extraction - The task of extracting factual knowledge from language models using prompt-based querying. The paper investigates prompt bias in this context.

- Language models (LMs) - Pre-trained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, etc. that are probed for factual knowledge using prompts. 

- Quantifying prompt bias - Measuring the extent of prompt bias using metrics like Jensen-Shannon divergence between the prompt bias distribution and a uniform distribution.

- Mitigating prompt bias - The main contribution of this paper - a representation-based debiasing approach to remove the biased component from LMs' internal representations. 

- Benchmark reliability - One negative impact of prompt bias is unreasonably amplifying performance on benchmarks through overfitting, which impairs reliability.

- Prompt retrieval capability - Another negative impact is that prompt bias misleads LMs and impairs their ability to correctly retrieve factual knowledge. 

- Debiased representations - The key idea behind the debiasing approach - generating debiased representation vectors by removing estimated biased representations and using them to produce debiased outputs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a representation-based approach to mitigate prompt bias. Can you elaborate on why operating in the representation space is more effective than adjusting output probabilities for debiasing? What are the advantages and limitations?

2. The key idea of the proposed approach is to identify and remove the biased component in representations using a prompt-only query. Can you explain why the prompt-only query can help estimate the prompt bias? What other strategies could be used to estimate prompt bias?

3. The paper performs debiasing by subtracting the representation of the prompt-only query from the representation of the original factual query. Have you considered other vector operations (e.g. projection, normalization) for removing the biased component? Why is subtraction a reasonable choice? 

4. The effectiveness of the proposed approach relies on the assumption that factual knowledge and prompt bias lie in distinct subspaces of the representation space. Is there any evidence to support this assumption based on probing the internal representations?

5. The paper focuses on mitigating prompt bias for typed querying in factual knowledge extraction. Do you think the proposed approach can generalize to untyped settings where the label space is unlimited? What adjustments might be needed?

6. Have you explored applying the debiasing approach to other factual knowledge extraction benchmarks besides LAMA, LAMA-UHN, and WIKI-UNI? How does it perform on datasets like Google-RE and ConceptNet?

7. The paper demonstrates the approach on BERT, RoBERTa and Llama2 models. Do you expect the debiasing effectiveness to change for more advanced factual knowledge models like KG-BERT and REALM? Why?

8. The results show state-of-the-art prompts like OptiPrompt do not significantly outperform manual prompts after debiasing. Do the complex prompt optimization techniques still have value? How can we enhance factual knowledge retrieval ability?

9. Can the proposed debiasing approach be extended to other prompt-based NLP tasks suffering from prompt bias, such as sentiment analysis, question answering? What adaptations would need to be made?

10. The paper identifies overfitting test datasets as one negative impact of prompt bias. Besides filtering biased data, what other strategies can help evaluate model performance more reliably under the influence of prompt bias?
