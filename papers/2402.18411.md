# [Unsupervised Cross-Domain Image Retrieval via Prototypical Optimal   Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18411)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR). In UCIR, the goal is to retrieve images from one visual domain that match the semantic category of a query image from a different domain, without relying on any labeled data. This is a challenging problem due to significant domain shifts across domains and lack of supervision. Prior methods typically treat UCIR as two separate tasks - intra-domain representation learning and cross-domain feature alignment. However, these segregated strategies overlook the potential synergies between the two tasks.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes ProtoOT, a novel optimal transport (OT) formulation tailored for UCIR. The key ideas are:

1) Integrate intra-domain representation learning and cross-domain alignment into a unified OT framework: The former provides representative features for alignment while the latter enhances representations by transferring cross-domain knowledge. Both tasks minimize distance between sample and prototype distributions to obtain discriminative features. 

2) Leverage strengths of K-means to handle distribution imbalances in UCIR: Use K-means to generate prototypes and approximate class distributions. Modify OT constraints based on this to handle imbalanced distributions effectively.

3) Further improve representations using contrastive learning: Bring features closer to augmentations, nearest neighbors and matched prototypes for local consistency. Explicitly push apart features and unmatched prototypes for global discriminativeness.

Main Contributions:

1) First unified OT framework simultaneously addressing intra-domain learning and cross-domain alignment for UCIR.

2) Novel ProtoOT formulation balancing strengths of K-means and OT to handle substantial distribution imbalances.

3) Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets - 24.44% average P@200 enhancement on DomainNet and 12.12% P@15 boost on Office-Home.

In summary, the paper introduces an integrated OT approach via ProtoOT to address key challenges in UCIR and demonstrates its effectiveness through comprehensive experiments.
