# [Bagged Deep Image Prior for Recovering Images in the Presence of Speckle   Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15635)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper addresses the problem of recovering a complex-valued image from multiple sets of measurements (referred to as looks) that have been degraded by speckle (multiplicative) noise as well as additive noise. 

- This is an important problem in coherent imaging systems where speckle noise poses a major challenge. Standard methods fail when the measurement matrix is under-sampled or ill-conditioned.

- The paper formulates a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach under a "deep image prior (DIP)" hypothesis that states natural images can be embedded in neural networks with fewer parameters. However, solving this optimization problem is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- Theoretically: Provides the first analytical upper bound on the mean squared error of the MLE estimator under the DIP assumption. The bound captures the dependence on key parameters like number of DIP parameters, number of looks, signal dimension, etc.

- Algorithmically: Proposes a "Bagged-DIP" based projected gradient descent method. Bagging trains multiple DIPs on random subsets to create diversity and averaging reduces variance. This handles overfitting issues in DIPs. Also uses an efficient Newton-Schulz update for the matrix inverse computation.

Main Contributions:  
- First theoretical performance guarantee for multilook imaging under DIP hypothesis that links MSE to problem parameters

- Concept of Bagged-DIP to enable use of complex neural networks in PGD while controlling overfitting 

- Using Newton-Schulz with only a single step per PGD iteration reduces computational complexity significantly

- State-of-the-art reconstruction performance demonstrated through simulations under various undersampling and noise levels

In summary, the paper provides important theoretical and algorithmic contributions for complex-valued image recovery from multilook speckle-corrupted measurements using deep image priors.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper develops a bagged deep image prior approach and projected gradient descent algorithm to effectively recover images from undersampled, speckle-corrupted measurements, providing theoretical analysis and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes both theoretical and algorithmic contributions for recovering images from undersampled, speckle-corrupted measurements.

The main theoretical contribution is establishing the first theoretical upper bound on the mean squared error (MSE) of the maximum likelihood estimator under the deep image prior hypothesis. The bound captures the dependence of MSE on factors like the number of parameters in the deep image prior, number of looks, signal dimension, etc.

The main algorithmic contributions are:

1) Proposing the concept of "Bagged-DIP" to address overfitting issues of complex deep image priors in projected gradient descent. This involves creating multiple weakly dependent DIP estimates and averaging them.

2) Using just one step of the Newton-Schulz iterative algorithm to approximate the matrix inverse computation in each PGD iteration. This drastically reduces computation time.

3) Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of the proposed Bagged-DIP based PGD algorithm on simulated undersampled, speckle-corrupted measurements.

In summary, the paper makes both theoretical and practical advances for image recovery under difficult acquisition scenarios involving undersampling and speckle noise corruption.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a "bagged" Deep Image Prior approach within a projected gradient descent algorithm. What is the intuition behind using multiple Deep Image Priors instead of just one? How does this "bagging" help improve performance?

2. The paper mentions two main challenges faced when using vanilla projected gradient descent with Deep Image Priors - choosing the right complexity DIP and computational complexity of matrix inversions. Explain these two challenges in more detail and how the proposed solutions address them.  

3. Explain the Newton-Schulz iterative algorithm for matrix inversion that is proposed to reduce computational complexity. Why is just one step of this algorithm sufficient in the context of this method?

4. One of the main theoretical contributions is an upper bound on the Mean Squared Error of the maximum likelihood estimator. Derive this bound and clearly explain each term, relating it back to properties of the method.  

5. The bound suggests that the MSE decays as $O(m^{3/2})$ with number of measurements $m$. Verify this claim experimentally on simulated data. Does the actual decay match your theoretical analysis?

6. For the "bagging" approach, the authors mention using patch sizes of 32, 64, and 128. Explore the impact of these hyperparameter choices on reconstruction quality. Does increased diversity in patch sizes always improve performance? 

7. The number of projection gradient descent iterations is set at 100, 200, and 300 for different undersampling rates. Justify this choice and experimentally determine if it is optimal. 

8. Compare the proposed approach against other deep learning based despeckling and reconstruction methods. Are the performance gains consistent across different noise levels and undersampling rates?

9. Theoretical analysis makes several simplifying assumptions about noise distributions, signal dynamic range etc. Evaluate how reconstruction degrades when such assumptions are violated in practice.

10. The current algorithm works on 2D images. Propose extensions to handle 3D/4D reconstruction from undersampled complex-valued data corrupted by speckle noise.
