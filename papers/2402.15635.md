# [Bagged Deep Image Prior for Recovering Images in the Presence of Speckle   Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15635)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper addresses the problem of recovering a complex-valued image from multiple sets of measurements (referred to as looks) that have been degraded by speckle (multiplicative) noise as well as additive noise. 

- This is an important problem in coherent imaging systems where speckle noise poses a major challenge. Standard methods fail when the measurement matrix is under-sampled or ill-conditioned.

- The paper formulates a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach under a "deep image prior (DIP)" hypothesis that states natural images can be embedded in neural networks with fewer parameters. However, solving this optimization problem is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- Theoretically: Provides the first analytical upper bound on the mean squared error of the MLE estimator under the DIP assumption. The bound captures the dependence on key parameters like number of DIP parameters, number of looks, signal dimension, etc.

- Algorithmically: Proposes a "Bagged-DIP" based projected gradient descent method. Bagging trains multiple DIPs on random subsets to create diversity and averaging reduces variance. This handles overfitting issues in DIPs. Also uses an efficient Newton-Schulz update for the matrix inverse computation.

Main Contributions:  
- First theoretical performance guarantee for multilook imaging under DIP hypothesis that links MSE to problem parameters

- Concept of Bagged-DIP to enable use of complex neural networks in PGD while controlling overfitting 

- Using Newton-Schulz with only a single step per PGD iteration reduces computational complexity significantly

- State-of-the-art reconstruction performance demonstrated through simulations under various undersampling and noise levels

In summary, the paper provides important theoretical and algorithmic contributions for complex-valued image recovery from multilook speckle-corrupted measurements using deep image priors.
