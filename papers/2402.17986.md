# [PolyOculus: Simultaneous Multi-view Image-based Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17986)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the problem of generative novel view synthesis (GNVS) - generating new, plausible views of a scene given a limited number of input views. Existing methods have limitations such as only being able to generate one view at a time in an autoregressive manner. This can lead to inconsistencies between generated views ("loop inconsistencies") and error accumulation over long sequences. The paper also highlights that for many view distributions like stereo image pairs or inward facing cameras around an object, there is no natural ordering. Imposing an ordering can be problematic.

Proposed Solution:
The main proposal is a set-based generative model that can simultaneously generate multiple consistent novel views conditioned on any number of input views. The model can flexibly condition on zero, one or more input views. By generating sets of views simultaneously, long sequences can be generated without restricting to a low order autoregressive approach, avoiding error accumulation. By avoiding imposing an ordering, inconsistencies are reduced and performance improved for unordered view distributions like loops.

The proposed model is a conditional latent variable diffusion model. It uses a multi-stream U-Net architecture where each view is processed independently except for cross-attention layers that enable information sharing. Camera ray directions are used to represent geometry. A camera canonicalization is used to make the model permutation invariant and invariant to global rigid transforms.

For sampling large sets of views in practice, a hybrid strategy is proposed that generates sets of views autoregressively but avoids accumulating errors by using keyframes and conditioning on multiple frames. The paper also proposes a heuristic to select an ordering for completely unordered sets of views.

Main Contributions:

- Formulation of GNVS as a set-to-set generation problem to avoid issues with autoregressive modeling
- A set-based generative model architecture based on diffusion models that can condition on variable numbers of views and generate multiple consistent views simultaneously
- A hybrid sampling strategy to make sampling of large view sets tractable
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets and showed particular benefits for challenging view distributions like loops and stereo pairs

The main innovation is the set-based formulation to avoid fundamental limitations of autoregressive GNVS. This enables flexible conditioning, simultaneous consistent view generation, and improved performance especially on complex view distributions without a natural ordering.
