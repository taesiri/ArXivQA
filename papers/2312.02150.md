# [Readout Guidance: Learning Control from Diffusion Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02150)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Readout Guidance: Learning Control from Diffusion Features":

Problem:
Existing methods for controlling text-to-image diffusion models typically require substantial model training on large annotated datasets, which is cumbersome and often infeasible for most users. There is a need for an efficient way to enable custom user control over text-to-image diffusion models.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes "Readout Guidance", which uses small auxiliary "readout heads" that can be easily trained on top of a frozen pre-trained diffusion model to extract signals, or "readouts", from the model's intermediate features. These readouts encode properties about the image being generated, including spatially-aligned properties like pose and depth as well as relative properties between images like correspondence and appearance similarity. The readouts are compared to user-defined targets during sampling to guide the image generation process towards desired constraints, enabling controlled image generation.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes readout heads that efficiently extract interpretable signals from diffusion features using little training data and parameters
- Formulates a general sampling-time guidance framework using distances between readouts and targets 
- Demonstrates controlled generation on tasks like drag-based manipulation, identity-consistent generation, and spatially-aligned control
- Shows combination with adapter-based conditional models to further improve control capabilities 
- Requires much less training data, shorter training times, and fewer parameters compared to prior conditional control techniques

The key advantage is the ability to add control capabilities to diffusion models easily, without expensive retraining or architectural changes. The readout guidance framework is general and can handle both spatially-aligned and relative constraints using the same overall approach.
