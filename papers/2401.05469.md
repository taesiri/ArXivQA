# [Robust CNN-based Respiration Rate Estimation for Smartwatch PPG and IMU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05469)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Respiratory rate (RR) is an important vital sign indicating medical conditions, but existing RR estimation methods fail for wrist-worn photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals collected during free-living conditions. 
- Wrist PPG signals are more susceptible to noise compared to finger PPG signals, especially in the low-frequency range relevant for RR.
- There is a need for a robust RR estimation method for smartwatch sensors to leverage temporal/spatial information in the noisy signals.

Proposed Solution:
- A deep learning model is proposed with two key modules - multi-scale convolution using dilated residual inception to capture features at different resolutions, and an estimator with CNN and dense layers to predict RR.  
- Raw PPG, accelerometer (ACC) and gyroscope (GYR) signals are inputs. Independent component analysis extracts respiratory signals from ACC/GYR.  
- Multi-scale convolution leverages parallel branches with diverse convolutional filter sizes to acquire weights for each resolution to determine recurring signal features, fused for next modules.

Key Contributions:
- Novel RR estimation using multi-sensor inputs from wrist devices by a CNN capturing multi-scale temporal patterns even in noisy data.
- Evaluation on free-living smartwatch dataset from 36 subjects, much more practical than existing works focusing on clean finger PPG.
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for RR estimation giving lowest error metrics like MAE 1.85, RMSE 2.34 and highest agreement of estimates to ground truth references.

In summary, the paper develops a deep CNN-based approach for robust RR estimation from multi-modal smartwatch sensors. The solution is tailored to address the key challenge of handling noise in data from wrist-worn devices used freely during daily activities. Evaluations demonstrate clear improvements in accuracy over existing methods on this highly practical application scenario.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a multi-scale convolution incorporated with residual inception networks for respiratory rate (RR) extraction from wrist-based physiological signals (PPG, accelerometer, gyroscope).

2. Evaluating the proposed method using smartwatch data collected under free-living conditions, which is more challenging than data collected in controlled settings. 

3. Assessing the proposed method's performance in terms of MAE, RMSE, parameter count, mean bias, and confidence interval compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results show the proposed method outperforms existing methods in accurately estimating RR from noisy wrist-based signals.

In summary, the paper proposes and evaluates a novel deep learning architecture for robust RR estimation from multi-modal smartwatch data collected in noisy real-world conditions. The method leverages temporal information in the physiological signals to accurately predict RR where traditional signal processing and machine learning methods struggle.
