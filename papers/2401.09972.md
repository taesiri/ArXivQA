# [Better Explain Transformers by Illuminating Important Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09972)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for explaining Transformer models rely on gradients or attention weights. However, not all information in gradients and attention is relevant for explanation, and irrelevant information can confuse explanations. 

Proposed Solution:
- Refine information flow in Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to focus on "important" information and reduce "irrelevant" information. Specifically:
  - Identify "syntactic" attention heads that capture core syntactic relations between words.
  - Identify "positional" heads that focus on relative token positions.
  - Propagate relevance scores through these heads to capture important internal and interaction information between tokens.
  - Mask other heads during LRP to reduce confusing irrelevant information.

Main Contributions:
1. Show that irrelevant information distorts attribution scores and should be masked during explanation computation.
2. Propose method to identify and propagate relevance through "important" syntactic and positional heads while masking other heads.
3. Experiments show the proposed method improves explanation performance over 8 baselines on text classification and QA datasets, with over 3-33% better on key metrics.
4. Analysis shows the approach better attributes scores based on individual tokens' internal properties and their interplay through syntactic relations.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that masking irrelevant information during relevance propagation improves faithfulness of explanations for Transformer models, by better capturing and highlighting the important internal and interaction information influencing predictions. The proposed refinements to LRP deliver superior performance over strong baseline methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to improve explanations of Transformers in NLP by refining the information flow in layer-wise relevance propagation to focus on illuminating important heads capturing syntactic relations and positional information while eliminating irrelevant heads.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, I would summarize the main contributions as:

1. The paper refines the information flow within the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) process by illuminating two types of important information - syntactic and positional heads. This helps focus the explanation on the most relevant parts of the input. 

2. Through experiments, the paper demonstrates that irrelevant information can hamper the LRP process and confuse the explanation. Masking irrelevant heads improves performance.

3. The proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on both classification and question answering tasks, with over 3% to 33% improvement on explanation metrics. This shows it can provide superior explanations.

In summary, the key ideas are refining LRP to focus on important heads, showing irrelevant heads hurt, and demonstrating improved performance compared to prior work. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!

The paper proposes a method to better explain Transformers by illuminating important information and eliminating irrelevant information during the LRP process. It identifies syntactic and positional heads as important attention heads to focus on, and masks irrelevant heads. The method is evaluated on classification and QA datasets using metrics like AOPC, LOdds and Precision@20. Ablation studies demonstrate that irrelevant information can negatively impact explanations. In summary, the key ideas revolve around improving Transformer explainability via refining information flow during LRP.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed method refine the information flow within the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) process to better explain transformers? What types of information does it aim to highlight and eliminate?

2. Explain the two types of important information the authors identify - syntactic and positional heads. How are these heads identified and why are they considered important for explaining transformers?

3. How does the proposed method construct the head mask used to refine LRP? Walk through the details of how the syntactic mask and positional mask are generated. 

4. Why do the authors hypothesize that eliminating irrelevant information in LRP will improve explanation performance? What analysis and experiments do they conduct to validate this?

5. Analyze Figure 3 showing the different types of important heads identified across datasets. What trends do you notice in terms of which layers and heads focus on positional vs. syntactic information?

6. How does the proposed method specifically propagate relevance through the identified important heads during LRP? Explain the mathematical details.

7. Critically analyze the ablation studies conducted. Do they adequately validate that the method can identify important heads and that irrelevant heads degrade performance? Suggest any additional analyses.  

8. By visualizing the attribution scores, analyze whether the proposed method appears better able to capture interaction and internal token information compared to baselines. Provide examples.

9. Discuss any limitations of the analysis performed to identify syntactic and positional heads. What other criteria could be used to define head importance?

10. The paper mentions limitations for very large language models. Speculate on how the method may need to be adapted to handle more complex interaction information beyond syntactic relationships.
