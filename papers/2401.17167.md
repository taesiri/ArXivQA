# [Planning, Creation, Usage: Benchmarking LLMs for Comprehensive Tool   Utilization in Real-World Complex Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17167)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating language models' tool utilization capabilities have limitations - they focus only on simple tool usage rather than the full process of planning, creating and using tools. 
- They also use simplified synthesized queries rather than complex real-world scenarios.
- There is a need for more comprehensive evaluation covering all aspects of tool utilization.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce UltraTool, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate language models' abilities for tool utilization within complex real-world tasks.
- It covers the full process including planning, tool creation, and tool usage across 6 key dimensions.  
- It uses real-world complex queries spanning diverse domains collected from experts.
- A key feature is separate evaluation of natural language planning before tool usage, eliminating reliance on pre-defined tools.

Main Contributions:  
- Comprehensive benchmark evaluating all aspects of tool utilization derived from complex real-world queries.
- Explicit evaluation of natural language planning and advanced tool creation capabilities.   
- Analysis of multiple state-of-the-art language models uncovers limitations and future opportunities in tool utilization.
- The benchmark provides novel insights into assessing language models' readiness for complex real-world tool utilization.

In summary, the paper introduces a more realistic and multifaceted benchmark for evaluating language models' proficiency in tool utilization that covers planning, creation and usage. Experiments on diverse models offer insights into current capacities and challenges.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that UltraTool evaluates planning ability independently before tool usage. Why is this important and how does it help simplify the subsequent tool usage tasks?

2. UltraTool incorporates nested tool callings where the output of one tool serves as input to another tool. What are the challenges this poses and how can models be improved to handle such nested dependencies effectively? 

3. The paper conducts both global-level and local-level evaluations. What are the relative merits and limitations of these two types of evaluations for benchmarking tool utilization capabilities?

4. Tool creation is evaluated on 5 detailed dimensions in UltraTool. Beyond accuracy, what other major aspects of tool creation ability does this evaluation methodology aim to capture?  

5. What are some real-world complexities that the queries in UltraTool aim to mirror compared to previous benchmarks? How do these complexities better represent challenges encountered in practice?

6. The construction methodology leverages both domain experts and LLMs like GPT-4. What are the relative roles and merits of the human involvement vs automated methods? 

7. What are some limitations of the tool skeleton structure used in UltraTool? How can the benchmark be extended to evaluate performance on actual tool implementations in the future?

8. The results show open-source LLMs lag significantly behind closed-source ones on tool creation and usage. What fundamental capabilities may still be lacking in open-source LLMs?

9. Format compliance is highlighted as a prerequisite for effective problem-solving. Beyond accuracy, what other challenges need to be solved to ensure LLMs generate properly formatted outputs?

10. How suitable is the LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation methodology for the diverse evaluation dimensions in UltraTool? What are some limitations and how can human evaluation play a complementary role?
