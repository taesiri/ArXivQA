## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "A Systematic Survey of Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models: Techniques and Applications":

Problem:
Prompt engineering has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. However, there is a lack of systematic organization and understanding of the diverse prompt engineering methods and their applications. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides a structured taxonomy and analysis of 29 distinct prompt engineering techniques categorized by their applications, including reasoning, reducing hallucinations, user interaction, and code generation. For each technique, the paper summarizes the prompting methodology, models and datasets used, strengths and limitations.

Key Contributions:
- Comprehensive taxonomy diagram organizing prompting techniques by application area to enable better understanding of this rapidly developing field
- Detailed analysis of cutting-edge prompting methods spanning foundational approaches like zero-shot prompting to more advanced methods like chain-of-thought and automatic prompting
- Breakdown of techniques covering applications, models tested, datasets utilized, and metrics measured
- Discussion of advantages and disadvantages of prompting techniques to shed light on comparative efficacy
- Valuable resource for researchers to get an overview of state-of-the-art advancements in prompt engineering and open challenges to facilitate future research

In summary, this paper systematically reviews the landscape of prompt engineering techniques for LLMs, providing structured insights to advance research by illuminating opportunities and considerations for responsible development of prompting capabilities.
