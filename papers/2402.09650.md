# [Foul prediction with estimated poses from soccer broadcast video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09650)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Predicting foul behavior is important in soccer but challenging due to small image size of players and difficulty in using ball/pose information
- Recent advances in computer vision enable player tracking and pose estimation but fewer studies on behavior prediction 
- Pedestrian intention prediction methods use spatio-temporal features like video and pose, but lacking in soccer behavior prediction

Proposed Solution:
- Authors propose FutureFoul, a deep learning method to anticipate soccer fouls by fusing video, bounding box, bbox image and pose data
- Curate a novel soccer foul dataset with 2,500 foul and 2,500 non-foul clips, with pose estimated using OCHuman
- Model uses combination of CNN and RNN (GRU) to effectively merge information from the 4 modalities

Key Contributions:
- Propose a new method and foul dataset to predict soccer fouls using estimated pose from video
- Fuse CNN and RNN to accurately merge multi-modal visual information 
- Experiments show full model outperforms ablated versions, validating utility of RNN, bbox, pose for prediction
- Analysis provides insights about success and failures - pose helps resolve ambiguity from only bbox positions
- Practical applications in referee decisions and player safety, also valuable reference for future research

In summary, the authors present FutureFoul, a novel deep learning approach leveraging estimated pose and multiple visual cues to effectively predict imminent foul behavior in soccer games. Both the technical novelty and real-world applicability make this an important contribution towards advancing video understanding and player safety in the sports domain.
