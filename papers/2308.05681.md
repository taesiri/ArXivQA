# [Hard No-Box Adversarial Attack on Skeleton-Based Human Action   Recognition with Skeleton-Motion-Informed Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05681)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How to generate effective adversarial attacks against skeleton-based human action recognition (S-HAR) models in a "hard no-box" setting where the attacker has no access to the victim model, training data, or labels? 

The key points are:

- Recently S-HAR models have been shown vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing attack methods require white-box access or queries to the victim model. 

- The authors propose a new "hard no-box" attack setting where the attacker has no access to the victim model, training data, or labels. This is a very challenging setting.

- They introduce a novel method to generate adversarial skeleton sequences in this hard no-box setting, using contrastive learning to model the motion manifold and a new skeleton-motion-informed (SMI) gradient calculation. 

- The SMI gradient incorporates motion dynamics into the attack gradient, unlike standard methods that assume each input dimension is independent. This improves attack transferability.

- Extensive experiments demonstrate their hard no-box attack poses a real threat to S-HAR classifiers, achieving high fooling rates without any access to the victim model or training data/labels.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that effective hard no-box attacks can be generated on S-HAR models by using contrastive learning and a motion-aware gradient. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new threat model called "hard no-box attack" for skeleton-based human activity recognition (S-HAR), where the attacker has no access to the victim model, training data, or labels. This is a very restricted attack setting.

2. It introduces a contrastive learning framework to learn a motion manifold without labels. This allows defining an adversarial loss to generate adversarial samples by dragging samples away from similar neighbors on the manifold.

3. It proposes a new "skeleton-motion-informed" (SMI) gradient that captures the dynamics of skeletal motions for computing the adversarial loss gradient. This is different from standard gradients that assume independence between dimensions. 

4. It presents new SMI-based attack strategies by incorporating the proposed SMI gradients into existing methods like I-FGSM and MI-FGSM. Experiments show SMI gradients improve attack transferability and imperceptibility.

5. Extensive experiments validate that the proposed hard no-box attack poses a real threat to S-HAR models, achieving high fooling rates under the restricted threat model. The new SMI gradients also boost transferability in black-box attacks.

In summary, the key ideas are introducing a more restricted but practical threat model for S-HAR, and developing a new dynamics-aware gradient to enable effective hard no-box attacks on skeletal motions. The proposed concepts and attack strategies are novel in the field.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new hard no-box adversarial attack on skeleton-based human action recognition that does not require access to the victim model, training data, or labels, and introduces a skeleton-motion-informed gradient to improve attack transferability and imperceptibility by incorporating motion dynamics into the gradient computation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on adversarial attacks for skeleton-based human action recognition:

- This paper proposes a new "hard no-box" threat model that requires no access to the victim model, training data, or labels. This is much more restrictive than typical white-box and black-box attack settings. Most prior work requires at least some access to the victim model or training data.

- To enable attacks under this restrictive setting, the paper develops a new "skeleton-motion-informed" (SMI) gradient that incorporates motion dynamics. This differs from typical approaches that treat each data dimension independently for gradient computation. Modeling motion dynamics helps improve attack transferability.

- The proposed method uses contrastive learning on unlabeled test data to learn a latent space to guide attacks, rather than relying on class boundaries. This is a novel unsupervised approach to estimate "class" boundaries without labels.

- Experiments demonstrate successful attacks on multiple models and datasets under the hard no-box setting. Attack success rates are comparable or sometimes better than transfer-based attacks that require training data/labels.

- The SMI gradient is shown to improve attack transferability and imperceptibility in both no-box and black-box attack scenarios compared to prior gradient-based attacks.

Overall, this paper introduces a highly challenging threat model and proposes innovative techniques including contrastive learning, motion-based gradients, and dynamics modeling to enable effective attacks under such restrictive settings. The techniques and analysis around no-box attacks and motion-based gradients advance the understanding of vulnerabilities in skeleton-based action recognition.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improve the transferability of adversarial attacks on skeleton-based human activity recognition (S-HAR). The authors note that their proposed skeleton-motion-informed (SMI) gradient can improve transferability in black-box attacks compared to other gradients, but there is still room for improvement. They suggest exploring other models and techniques to further boost transferability using the dynamics captured by the SMI gradient.

- Apply the SMI gradient concept to other time series data beyond skeletal motions, such as stock prices or videos. The modeling of dynamics in the SMI gradient may be useful for tasks like time series generation and synthesis.

- Develop more robust defenses against the proposed hard no-box attack setting. The authors validate randomized smoothing as one potential defense, but suggest more work is needed here, especially since their attack requires minimal knowledge. Developing effective defenses against hard no-box attacks could significantly reduce security risks.

- Explore the applicability of the proposed contrastive learning framework and adversarial manifold loss to other problem settings beyond just S-HAR attacks. The authors present these as more general techniques for distinguishing data samples without labels.

- Analyze theoretically why attack success rates vary across different models and datasets. The authors observe this variance but leave a deeper analysis for future work.

In summary, the main future directions are improving attack transferability, applying the SMI gradient to other data, developing defenses against hard no-box attacks, generalizing the contrastive learning approach, and theoretical analysis of model/dataset differences. The authors lay out promising initial steps but highlight the need for more work in these areas.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new hard no-box adversarial attack method for skeleton-based human activity recognition (S-HAR) that requires no access to the victim model, training data, or labels. The authors first use contrastive learning to learn a latent motion manifold that aggregates similar samples, enabling adversarial sample generation without labels. They design a no-box adversarial loss to maximize dissimilarity to positive samples and minimize similarity to negative samples in the latent space. To improve on standard gradient-based attacks, the authors propose a skeleton-motion-informed (SMI) gradient that captures motion dynamics for computing the loss gradient. This results in a new family of gradient-based attack strategies that outperform standard methods in fooling rate and perceptual quality. Experiments across datasets and models demonstrate the threat of the hard no-box attack and the benefits of the proposed SMI gradient. Key contributions are confirming the vulnerability of S-HAR models with minimal attacker knowledge, modeling motion dynamics in the attack gradient, and improving attack effectiveness and imperceptibility.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new hard no-box attack for skeleton-based human action recognition (S-HAR) that requires minimal prior knowledge. Existing attacks require access to the victim model, training data, or labels. In contrast, the proposed hard no-box attack only needs unlabeled testing data. 

The key ideas are: 1) Use contrastive learning on the unlabeled testing data to learn a motion manifold that aggregates similar motions. This manifold provides guidance for the attack without labels. 2) Design a no-box adversarial loss to maximize dissimilarity to positive samples and minimize similarity to negative samples on the manifold. This loss can be optimized with gradient-based attacks. 3) Propose a skeleton-motion-informed (SMI) gradient that incorporates motion dynamics into the gradient computation to improve attack effectiveness and sample quality. Experiments show the attack poses a real threat and the SMI gradient enhances attack transferability and imperceptibility in both no-box and black-box settings. Overall, the paper presents the first hard no-box attack for S-HAR and proposes novel strategies to attack with minimal information.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a new hard no-box adversarial attack method for skeleton-based human action recognition (S-HAR). The key contributions are:

1. They propose a new threat model called hard no-box attack, where the attacker has no access to the victim model, training data, or labels. This is the most challenging setting among adversarial attacks on S-HAR. 

2. To enable the attack without labels, they use contrastive learning to learn a motion manifold that aggregates similar skeletal motions. The manifold provides guidance on generating adversaries by computing a new no-box adversarial loss to drag samples away from similar motions.

3. They propose a novel skeleton-motion-informed (SMI) gradient that captures the dynamics in skeletal motions for computing the adversarial loss gradient. This results in a more effective search for adversaries near the motion manifold compared to standard gradients. 

4. The SMI gradient allows creating a family of new attack methods by integrating with existing gradient-based attacks like I-FGSM and MI-FGSM. Extensive experiments demonstrate their hard no-box attacks can successfully fool S-HAR models without access to any victim model information or training data.

In summary, the key innovation is the introduction of a new hard no-box threat model for S-HAR and the design of contrastive learning and motion dynamics modeling to enable effective attacks under such restrictive settings. The SMI gradient also improves attack transferability and imperceptibility.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is the vulnerability of skeleton-based human activity recognition (S-HAR) models to adversarial attacks. 

Specifically, the paper points out that prior work has shown S-HAR models can be fooled by adversarial examples, but existing attack methods require a lot of knowledge about the victim model (white-box attacks) or access to training data/frequent queries (black-box attacks). The authors argue these requirements are impractical in real-world scenarios.

To address this, the paper introduces a new "hard no-box" attack setting where the attacker has no access to the victim model, training data, or labels - only unlabeled test data. The key challenges are generating effective adversarial samples without access to the model or ground truth labels to guide the attack.

The main contributions aim to tackle this hard no-box setting:

- Proposing the first hard no-box attack method for skeleton-based action recognition, to the authors' knowledge.

- Introducing a "skeleton-motion-informed" (SMI) gradient that incorporates motion dynamics to guide the attack, unlike standard gradients that treat each input dimension independently.

- Showing the SMI gradient can augment existing attack strategies like I-FGSM and MI-FGSM to create stronger no-box attacks with better transferability and imperceptibility.

In summary, the key problem is performing adversarial attacks on S-HAR models without relying on model access, training data, or labels. The paper aims to demonstrate this is feasible via a new hard no-box attack paradigm and motion-aware gradients.
