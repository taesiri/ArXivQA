# [Hard No-Box Adversarial Attack on Skeleton-Based Human Action   Recognition with Skeleton-Motion-Informed Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05681)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How to generate effective adversarial attacks against skeleton-based human action recognition (S-HAR) models in a "hard no-box" setting where the attacker has no access to the victim model, training data, or labels? 

The key points are:

- Recently S-HAR models have been shown vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing attack methods require white-box access or queries to the victim model. 

- The authors propose a new "hard no-box" attack setting where the attacker has no access to the victim model, training data, or labels. This is a very challenging setting.

- They introduce a novel method to generate adversarial skeleton sequences in this hard no-box setting, using contrastive learning to model the motion manifold and a new skeleton-motion-informed (SMI) gradient calculation. 

- The SMI gradient incorporates motion dynamics into the attack gradient, unlike standard methods that assume each input dimension is independent. This improves attack transferability.

- Extensive experiments demonstrate their hard no-box attack poses a real threat to S-HAR classifiers, achieving high fooling rates without any access to the victim model or training data/labels.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that effective hard no-box attacks can be generated on S-HAR models by using contrastive learning and a motion-aware gradient. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new threat model called "hard no-box attack" for skeleton-based human activity recognition (S-HAR), where the attacker has no access to the victim model, training data, or labels. This is a very restricted attack setting.

2. It introduces a contrastive learning framework to learn a motion manifold without labels. This allows defining an adversarial loss to generate adversarial samples by dragging samples away from similar neighbors on the manifold.

3. It proposes a new "skeleton-motion-informed" (SMI) gradient that captures the dynamics of skeletal motions for computing the adversarial loss gradient. This is different from standard gradients that assume independence between dimensions. 

4. It presents new SMI-based attack strategies by incorporating the proposed SMI gradients into existing methods like I-FGSM and MI-FGSM. Experiments show SMI gradients improve attack transferability and imperceptibility.

5. Extensive experiments validate that the proposed hard no-box attack poses a real threat to S-HAR models, achieving high fooling rates under the restricted threat model. The new SMI gradients also boost transferability in black-box attacks.

In summary, the key ideas are introducing a more restricted but practical threat model for S-HAR, and developing a new dynamics-aware gradient to enable effective hard no-box attacks on skeletal motions. The proposed concepts and attack strategies are novel in the field.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new hard no-box adversarial attack on skeleton-based human action recognition that does not require access to the victim model, training data, or labels, and introduces a skeleton-motion-informed gradient to improve attack transferability and imperceptibility by incorporating motion dynamics into the gradient computation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on adversarial attacks for skeleton-based human action recognition:

- This paper proposes a new "hard no-box" threat model that requires no access to the victim model, training data, or labels. This is much more restrictive than typical white-box and black-box attack settings. Most prior work requires at least some access to the victim model or training data.

- To enable attacks under this restrictive setting, the paper develops a new "skeleton-motion-informed" (SMI) gradient that incorporates motion dynamics. This differs from typical approaches that treat each data dimension independently for gradient computation. Modeling motion dynamics helps improve attack transferability.

- The proposed method uses contrastive learning on unlabeled test data to learn a latent space to guide attacks, rather than relying on class boundaries. This is a novel unsupervised approach to estimate "class" boundaries without labels.

- Experiments demonstrate successful attacks on multiple models and datasets under the hard no-box setting. Attack success rates are comparable or sometimes better than transfer-based attacks that require training data/labels.

- The SMI gradient is shown to improve attack transferability and imperceptibility in both no-box and black-box attack scenarios compared to prior gradient-based attacks.

Overall, this paper introduces a highly challenging threat model and proposes innovative techniques including contrastive learning, motion-based gradients, and dynamics modeling to enable effective attacks under such restrictive settings. The techniques and analysis around no-box attacks and motion-based gradients advance the understanding of vulnerabilities in skeleton-based action recognition.
