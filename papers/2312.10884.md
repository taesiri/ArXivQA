# [Contextual Reinforcement Learning for Offshore Wind Farm Bidding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10884)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Renewable energy systems like wind and solar face uncertainty in energy production which makes integration with power grids challenging. Two-stage stochastic programs (SP) are commonly used to optimize decision making for renewable systems under uncertainty, but face scalability issues with the number of scenarios. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose using reinforcement learning (RL) to learn near-optimal solutions for the first stage decision variables of a contextual two-stage SP. The RL agent observes the problem data/context and predicts the first stage variables. The environment then fixes those variables and solves the second stage SP to return a reward.  

- They apply this framework to an offshore wind farm bidding strategy by training an RL agent (DDPG algorithm) to predict the day-ahead market commitment based on the problem context. The reward is the optimized revenue from the full two-stage SP solved in the environment.

Main Contributions:
- A novel framework where RL is used to predict first stage solutions of a contextual two-stage SP. This avoids solving the full stochastic program.

- Demonstrate the framework on an offshore wind farm case study for day-ahead bidding. Show initial results that the agent starts to learn better bidding decisions.

- Identify areas for improvement - using more scenarios, hyperparameter tuning, longer training, adjusting rewards.

- Discussion on computational tradeoffs of using RL versus directly solving the SP. Identify cases where RL could be more desirable (e.g. more complex second stage models).

In summary, the paper proposes and demonstrates an RL approach to learn first-stage solutions of two-stage SPs applied to an offshore wind farm bidding problem. Key next steps are improving agent performance and applying this framework to more complex problems.
