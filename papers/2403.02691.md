# [InjecAgent: Benchmarking Indirect Prompt Injections in Tool-Integrated   Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02691)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are being integrated as agents that can access tools and external content. This introduces risks of indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious instructions are embedded in the content processed by the LLM agents, manipulating them into executing harmful actions against users.

Solution: 
- The paper introduces a new benchmark called InjecAgent to assess IPI vulnerabilities in tool-integrated LLM agents.

- InjecAgent contains 1,054 test cases covering 17 user tools and 62 attacker tools across domains like finance, smart home, email etc. Attacks are categorized into direct harm (e.g. financial transactions) and data stealing.

- Test cases are generated with GPT-4's assistance and manually refined. Each case has a user instruction, simulated tool response with attacker content, and evaluation of agent's reaction.
 
- An enhanced setting with a hacking prompt is introduced to examine its impact on attack outcomes.

Contributions:

- First formalization of IPI attacks on tool-integrated LLM agents 

- Introduction of InjecAgent - a novel, realistic benchmark serving as the standard to evaluate agent resilience to IPI attacks

- Evaluation of 30 LLM agents using InjecAgent, revealing vulnerability to attacks (e.g. 24% attack success for GPT-4). Higher rates observed with hacking prompts.

- Fine-tuned agents like GPT-4 are more resilient than prompted agents.

Overall, the paper exposes risks of indirect prompt injection on LLM agents, proposes a standardized benchmark for evaluation, and provides findings to enhance safety and reliability.
