# [OOTDiffusion: Outfitting Fusion based Latent Diffusion for Controllable   Virtual Try-on](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01779)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "OOTDiffusion: Outfitting Fusion based Latent Diffusion for Controllable Virtual Try-on":

Problem:
- Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) aims to generate an image of a person wearing a given clothing item. This is useful for online shopping but is challenging to generate high-fidelity and controllable results.
- Previous VTON methods using GANs often generate unrealistic results. Recent diffusion model-based methods rely on lossy feature fusion, losing detail. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose OOTDiffusion, a novel latent diffusion model architecture for controllable high-fidelity VTON.
- Key ideas:
    - Outfitting UNet efficiently learns precise clothing details in latent space in one step.
    - Outfitting fusion seamlessly incorporates clothing details into the diffusion model's denoising UNet via self-attention, preventing detail loss.
    - Outfitting dropout during training enables adjusting clothing detail strength at inference for control.

Main Contributions:  
- Outfitting UNet and outfitting fusion allow generating high-fidelity results with preserved fine details without needing explicit spatial alignment.
- Outfitting dropout enables classifier-free guidance over clothing details.
- Trained high-resolution models on VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets outperform state-of-the-art in fidelity and controllability.
- Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate controllable high-quality VTON on varied human poses and clothing items.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel architecture for latent diffusion model-based VTON that generates highly realistic and controllable results by efficiently learning and fusing precise clothing details without spatial alignment. The clothing detail control further improves result quality and user experience.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Outfitting over Try-on Diffusion (OOTDiffusion), a novel latent diffusion model-based architecture for controllable and high-fidelity image-based virtual try-on that efficiently learns precise garment details via an outfitting UNet and incorporates them into the denoising UNet through outfitting fusion without needing an explicit warping process.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes OOTDiffusion, a novel LDM-based network architecture for realistic and controllable virtual try-on. 

2. It designs an outfitting UNet to learn precise garment features and align them with the target human body via the proposed outfitting fusion process without an explicit warping step.

3. It introduces outfitting dropout during training to enable classifier-free guidance which further improves the controllability of the outfitting UNet.

4. It trains OOTDiffusion models on two high-resolution benchmark datasets - VITON-HD and Dress Code - and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance compared to previous VTON methods in both fidelity and controllability through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new method (OOTDiffusion) for virtual try-on that can generate high quality and controllable outfitted images by effectively learning and incorporating garment details into the diffusion process.
