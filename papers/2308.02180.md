# [Scaling Clinical Trial Matching Using Large Language Models: A Case   Study in Oncology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02180)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can large language models (LLMs) be applied to scale clinical trial matching, using oncology as a case study?More specifically, the key questions investigated in this paper appear to be:- Can LLMs structure elaborate eligibility criteria of clinical trials and extract complex matching logic (e.g. nested AND/OR/NOT)? - How do LLMs compare to prior strong baselines and expert systems for structuring trial eligibility criteria?- Can LLMs be applied to end-to-end clinical trial matching against patient records? What are the challenges and limitations?So in summary, the central hypothesis is that LLMs can be used to scale clinical trial matching by automating the structuring of eligibility criteria and matching against patient data. The paper explores this hypothesis through a case study in oncology, comparing LLMs like GPT-4 against other methods and evaluating their capabilities and limitations for real-world clinical trial matching.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting the first systematic study on using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for scaling clinical trial matching, with a focus on oncology. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Demonstrating that out-of-the-box, GPT-4 can already structure elaborate eligibility criteria of clinical trials and extract complex matching logic involving disease histology and genomic biomarkers. This substantially outperforms prior strong baselines like Criteria2Query and biomedical entity extraction tools.- Conducting both intrinsic evaluation on trial structuring and end-to-end matching evaluation using expert-annotated test sets and legacy enrollment data. The results show GPT-4 is competitive even compared to an expert system developed with extensive domain-specific heuristics. - Exploring the application of GPT-4 for end-to-end clinical trial matching. While preliminary, the results illustrate the potential of harnessing general cognitive capabilities of LLMs.- Identifying key growth areas for LLMs in clinical trial matching, such as addressing context limitation and accuracy issues in extracting information from patient electronic medical records.Overall, the paper demonstrates the promise of LLMs in scaling clinical trial matching and provides a systematic study to motivate further research in this direction. The techniques may generalize to trial matching beyond oncology.
