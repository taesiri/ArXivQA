# [Scaling Clinical Trial Matching Using Large Language Models: A Case   Study in Oncology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02180)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can large language models (LLMs) be applied to scale clinical trial matching, using oncology as a case study?More specifically, the key questions investigated in this paper appear to be:- Can LLMs structure elaborate eligibility criteria of clinical trials and extract complex matching logic (e.g. nested AND/OR/NOT)? - How do LLMs compare to prior strong baselines and expert systems for structuring trial eligibility criteria?- Can LLMs be applied to end-to-end clinical trial matching against patient records? What are the challenges and limitations?So in summary, the central hypothesis is that LLMs can be used to scale clinical trial matching by automating the structuring of eligibility criteria and matching against patient data. The paper explores this hypothesis through a case study in oncology, comparing LLMs like GPT-4 against other methods and evaluating their capabilities and limitations for real-world clinical trial matching.
