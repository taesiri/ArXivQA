# [Informed Spectral Normalized Gaussian Processes for Trajectory   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11966)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models require large amounts of training data to provide robust performance, which is costly to acquire in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving. This leads to poor data efficiency and lack of robustness to shifts across locations.
- Existing methods to integrate prior knowledge like constraints or transfer learning have limitations regarding qualitative knowledge or catastrophic forgetting. 
- Typical probabilistic deep learning models that can leverage prior knowledge through informative priors are computationally expensive.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a regularization-based continual learning method to enable the use of informative priors with spectral normalized Gaussian processes (SNGPs). SNGPs are efficient probabilistic models using a Gaussian process as the last layer of a neural network.
- The method builds on online elastic weight consolidation, using the Gaussian prior and Hessian-based Laplace approximation from SNGP to regularize the last layer. Simple L2 regularization is used for the feature extractor.
- This allows integrating prior expert and world knowledge from arbitrary ``knowledge tasks'' into SNGP models through the PIL approach without needing rehearsal memory or parameter expansions.

Main Contributions:  
- Novel continual learning method for SNGPs enabling the PIL approach to integrate informative priors
- Application to trajectory prediction for autonomous driving by representing drivability knowledge as prior
- Proposed informed CoverNet-SNGP model shows improved data efficiency and robustness to location shifts
- Outperforms informed and non-informed baselines, especially in low data regimes, on NuScenes and Argoverse datasets

In summary, the paper introduces a conceptually simple regularization-based approach to integrate informative priors into efficient SNGP models. When applied for trajectory prediction, this improves data efficiency and robustness, demonstrating the viability of using the proposed continual learning method to regularize SNGPs in a PIL approach.
