## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain tumor that is difficult to diagnose and segment due to its heterogeneity in MRI appearance. Accurate automated segmentation is needed to aid treatment planning and prognosis predictions. The BraTS challenge provides multimodal MRI scans to develop and evaluate automated brain tumor segmentation techniques.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose GLIMS, an attention-guided hybrid 3D segmentation model with the following key components:

1. Depth-Wise Multi-Scale Feature Extraction (DMSF) modules to extract features at multiple resolutions for both local and global context.

2. Swin Transformer blocks to enhance global feature learning in the deeper layers of the encoder-decoder structure. 

3. Channel and Spatial Attention (CSA) blocks to refine encoder features before fusing them to the decoder via skip connections. This guides the decoder's mask predictions.

4. Deep supervision with auxiliary losses at multiple decoder levels for better gradient flow and performance.

5. Extensive data augmentations and patch-based training for efficiency and robustness. 

6. Post-processing techniques like false positive removal, threshold adjustment and connected component analysis to boost metric scores.

Contributions:

1. A lightweight yet effective 3D hybrid model using transformers and convolutional blocks for brain tumor segmentation.

2. Novel depth-wise multi-scale feature extraction blocks for improved local and global contexts.

3. Attention guidance of decoder using refined encoder features to enhance mask predictions.

4. Thorough analysis of various post-processing methods to boost validation performance. 

5. State-of-the-art results on BraTS 2023 validation leaderboard, ranking among top 5 approaches. Robust performance on test set as well.

In summary, the paper presents GLIMS, a hybrid segmentation model with attention guidance and deep supervision that achieved excellent performance on the BraTS brain tumor segmentation task. The insights on post-processing also showcase improved metric scores.
