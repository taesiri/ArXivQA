# [REPAIR: Rank Correlation and Noisy Pair Half-replacing with Memory for   Noisy Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08224)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of "noisy correspondence" in cross-modal matching, which refers to alignment errors present in multimodal data pairs (e.g. image-text pairs). Noisy correspondence severely degrades the performance of existing cross-modal matching models that assume the training data is properly aligned. Prior methods to handle this issue have two main limitations: (1) they accumulate self-reinforcing errors when estimating the matching degree (soft correspondence) of noisy pairs, and (2) they handle completely mismatched pairs improperly by either using them directly in training or simply discarding them.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new framework called REPAIR that maintains a memory bank of clean (properly matched) data pair features and addresses the two aforementioned limitations. 

First, to avoid self-reinforcing errors, REPAIR uses "rank correlation" between the memory bank features and target features across modalities to estimate soft correspondence of target pairs. The key idea is that relative similarity relationships should be consistent across connected modalities for matched pairs. 

Second, for completely mismatched pairs, REPAIR uses a "noisy pair half-replacing" (NPR) strategy that replaces the feature of one modality with the most similar feature from the memory bank to create a new, better aligned pair for training. This avoids wasting the mismatched pairs while preventing them from degrading the model.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes using rank correlation with a memory bank to estimate soft correspondence of pairs, avoiding self-reinforcing errors of prior methods
- Introduces a novel noisy pair half-replacing strategy to make better use of completely mismatched pairs
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3 datasets with both synthetic and real-world noise
- Provides a general framework that can be integrated into existing models to improve robustness to noise

In summary, the key novelty is the use of the memory bank for robust soft correspondence estimation and improved utilization of mismatched pairs, overcoming limitations of prior noisy correspondence methods. Experiments validate effectiveness.
