# [FrustumFormer: Adaptive Instance-aware Resampling for Multi-view 3D   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04467)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we design an adaptive view transformation module that focuses more on instance regions rather than treating all regions equally during multi-view 3D object detection?The key hypothesis is that selecting the right features to transform and putting more focus on instance regions is important for effectively fusing multi-view features into bird's eye view representation. To validate this, the paper proposes a new method called FrustumFormer with the following key ideas:- Adaptive Instance-aware Resampling (AIR) to selectively focus on instance regions by generating instance frustum queries and predicting occupancy masks. - Temporal Frustum Fusion to reduce localization uncertainty by aggregating hints from historical instance frustums.- Overall framework to effectively integrate AIR and temporal fusion to learn instance-aware bird's eye view features for improved 3D detection.The experiments on nuScenes dataset validate their hypothesis, showing significant gains over prior arts by using adaptive sampling focused on instances rather than treating all regions equally. The core research contribution is in highlighting the importance of "what to transform" during view transformation for 3D detection.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:The paper proposes FrustumFormer, a multi-view 3D object detection method that adaptively focuses on instance regions during feature transformation from 2D image views to 3D bird's eye view by leveraging instance-aware resampling within predicted frustums and their temporal aggregation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in multi-view 3D object detection:- This paper proposes a new method called FrustumFormer that focuses on adaptively transforming image features into bird's eye view (BEV) based on instance locations. This is a novel perspective compared to prior work like BEVDet, BEVFormer, etc. that treat all image regions equally during view transformation. - The core technical contribution is the adaptive instance-aware resampling module, which uses instance frustums from 2D detections to guide sparse sampling in 3D. This allows concentrating more on informative object regions versus empty background. An occupancy mask refinement and temporal frustum fusion further improve instance localization.- Extensive experiments on nuScenes dataset demonstrate effectiveness. Without any bells & whistles, FrustumFormer achieves new state-of-the-art results of 51.6 mAP and 58.9 NDS on the test set. This is a good improvement over previous methods like PolarFormer.- The idea of adaptive/content-aware view transformation seems promising. This paper makes a first attempt in this direction for multi-view 3D detection. More exploration can be done along this line in future work.- For limitations, the approach relies on 2D detection to get instance frustums. Performance could degrade for small objects with inaccurate 2D boxes. The model also doesn't use any auxiliary depth supervision unlike some recent works.Overall, this paper introduces a novel perspective to multi-view 3D detection and shows promising results. The idea of adaptive view transformation has potential for future research. More thorough investigation on how to make view transformation content-adaptive would be interesting.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest the following future research directions:- Improving the quality of instance proposals in image views to provide better geometric constraints for the bird's eye view. More accurate instance segmentation and depth estimation in perspective views could help generate higher quality frustums.- Exploring uncertainty modeling in the occupancy mask prediction and temporal frustum fusion module. The predicted occupancy mask and historical frustum fusion both contain uncertainty. Modeling the uncertainty explicitly may help improve robustness.- Extending the idea of adaptive instance-aware resampling to other 3D perception tasks like point cloud segmentation or monocular 3D detection. The concept of focusing on informative regions can be generalized.- Designing a better view contention-aware feature aggregation scheme. Though adaptive instance resampling helps select important regions, how to best integrate features from different views still needs investigation. Attention models conditioned on view contents may help.- Applying the idea of instance frustum to aid multi-modality fusion in 3D detection when leveraging both images and LiDAR data. The frustum provides 3D geometric constraints from images that can complement LiDAR points.- Investigating end-to-end joint optimization of the components in the pipeline. Currently the instance segmentation, depth estimation, frustum generation are optimized separately. An end-to-end framework may help improve performance.In summary, the authors propose improving the image-based components that provide geometric cues, exploring uncertainty modeling, generalizing the idea to other tasks, designing better view-aware feature fusion, aiding multi-modality fusion, and investigating end-to-end joint optimization as potential future directions. The core focus is on enhancing the use of geometric constraints from images to aid 3D perception.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes FrustumFormer, a novel framework for multi-view 3D object detection. The key idea is to transform image features to bird's eye view (BEV) in an adaptive instance-aware manner. Specifically, it generates instance frustums from 2D detections to provide geometric hints for object locations in BEV. An occupancy mask is predicted to refine the localization. Temporal frustum fusion further reduces uncertainty. This allows focusing more on informative instance regions during view transformation. Experiments on nuScenes show FrustumFormer achieves state-of-the-art 51.6 mAP without LiDAR supervision. The adaptive instance-aware view transformation is shown to be effective for learning discriminative instance features in BEV.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes FrustumFormer, a novel framework for multi-view 3D object detection. The key idea is to perform adaptive instance-aware resampling during the transformation of features from 2D perspective views to 3D bird's eye view (BEV). Instead of treating all image regions equally, FrustumFormer focuses more on instance regions that are likely to contain objects. First, the model generates instance frustums in BEV based on 2D detections in perspective views. These frustums provide hints about object locations. An occupancy mask predictor further refines the frustum areas. In addition, a temporal frustum fusion module aggregates frustums over time to reduce location uncertainty. During feature transformation, the model performs adaptive instance-aware resampling by focusing cross-attention computation on the predicted instance frustums. This enhances learning of instance-aware BEV features. Experiments on nuScenes dataset demonstrate improved performance over prior arts. FrustumFormer achieves 51.6 mAP and 58.9 NDS without extra bells and whistles.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a novel framework called FrustumFormer for multi-view 3D object detection. The key idea is to perform adaptive instance-aware resampling during the transformation of image features from 2D perspective views to 3D bird's eye view (BEV). Specifically, the method leverages instance masks from 2D detections to generate instance frustum queries in 3D BEV space. These frustum queries selectively attend to image features that fall inside the frustum, enhancing the learning of instance-aware BEV features. An occupancy mask is further predicted to refine the instance locations. Temporal frustum fusion is also used to reduce localization uncertainty. By focusing more on informative instance regions instead of treating all image content equally, FrustumFormer is able to achieve improved 3D detection performance, especially for occluded and small objects, as demonstrated on the nuScenes dataset.
