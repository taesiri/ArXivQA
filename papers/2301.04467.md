# [FrustumFormer: Adaptive Instance-aware Resampling for Multi-view 3D   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04467)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we design an adaptive view transformation module that focuses more on instance regions rather than treating all regions equally during multi-view 3D object detection?The key hypothesis is that selecting the right features to transform and putting more focus on instance regions is important for effectively fusing multi-view features into bird's eye view representation. To validate this, the paper proposes a new method called FrustumFormer with the following key ideas:- Adaptive Instance-aware Resampling (AIR) to selectively focus on instance regions by generating instance frustum queries and predicting occupancy masks. - Temporal Frustum Fusion to reduce localization uncertainty by aggregating hints from historical instance frustums.- Overall framework to effectively integrate AIR and temporal fusion to learn instance-aware bird's eye view features for improved 3D detection.The experiments on nuScenes dataset validate their hypothesis, showing significant gains over prior arts by using adaptive sampling focused on instances rather than treating all regions equally. The core research contribution is in highlighting the importance of "what to transform" during view transformation for 3D detection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes a new framework called FrustumFormer for multi-view 3D object detection. - It introduces the idea of "adaptive instance-aware resampling (AIR)" for view transformation. The key idea is to focus more on transforming features from object instance regions rather than treating all regions equally.- It designs the AIR technique with two components: (1) instance frustum query generation using 2D detections to locate potential 3D object regions (2) learning an occupancy mask to refine the instance locations. - It also incorporates temporal information by fusing historical instance frustums to reduce localization uncertainty.- Experiments on nuScenes dataset show the proposed FrustumFormer framework with AIR significantly improves performance over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the adaptive instance-aware view transformation idea for multi-view 3D detection, and designing the FrustumFormer framework to effectively realize this idea. The results demonstrate its effectiveness.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:The paper proposes FrustumFormer, a multi-view 3D object detection method that adaptively focuses on instance regions during feature transformation from 2D image views to 3D bird's eye view by leveraging instance-aware resampling within predicted frustums and their temporal aggregation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in multi-view 3D object detection:- This paper proposes a new method called FrustumFormer that focuses on adaptively transforming image features into bird's eye view (BEV) based on instance locations. This is a novel perspective compared to prior work like BEVDet, BEVFormer, etc. that treat all image regions equally during view transformation. - The core technical contribution is the adaptive instance-aware resampling module, which uses instance frustums from 2D detections to guide sparse sampling in 3D. This allows concentrating more on informative object regions versus empty background. An occupancy mask refinement and temporal frustum fusion further improve instance localization.- Extensive experiments on nuScenes dataset demonstrate effectiveness. Without any bells & whistles, FrustumFormer achieves new state-of-the-art results of 51.6 mAP and 58.9 NDS on the test set. This is a good improvement over previous methods like PolarFormer.- The idea of adaptive/content-aware view transformation seems promising. This paper makes a first attempt in this direction for multi-view 3D detection. More exploration can be done along this line in future work.- For limitations, the approach relies on 2D detection to get instance frustums. Performance could degrade for small objects with inaccurate 2D boxes. The model also doesn't use any auxiliary depth supervision unlike some recent works.Overall, this paper introduces a novel perspective to multi-view 3D detection and shows promising results. The idea of adaptive view transformation has potential for future research. More thorough investigation on how to make view transformation content-adaptive would be interesting.
