# [FrustumFormer: Adaptive Instance-aware Resampling for Multi-view 3D   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04467)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we design an adaptive view transformation module that focuses more on instance regions rather than treating all regions equally during multi-view 3D object detection?The key hypothesis is that selecting the right features to transform and putting more focus on instance regions is important for effectively fusing multi-view features into bird's eye view representation. To validate this, the paper proposes a new method called FrustumFormer with the following key ideas:- Adaptive Instance-aware Resampling (AIR) to selectively focus on instance regions by generating instance frustum queries and predicting occupancy masks. - Temporal Frustum Fusion to reduce localization uncertainty by aggregating hints from historical instance frustums.- Overall framework to effectively integrate AIR and temporal fusion to learn instance-aware bird's eye view features for improved 3D detection.The experiments on nuScenes dataset validate their hypothesis, showing significant gains over prior arts by using adaptive sampling focused on instances rather than treating all regions equally. The core research contribution is in highlighting the importance of "what to transform" during view transformation for 3D detection.
