# [Improving Demonstration Diversity by Human-Free Fusing for Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10663)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing text-to-SQL methods rely on human-labeled demonstrations, which have two issues: (1) insufficient diversity, limiting model performance, and (2) high labeling overhead.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a metric to measure diversity of demonstrations and show that existing human-labeled demonstrations have insufficient diversity.  
- Propose a method called FUSED (FUSing itEratively for Demonstrations) that iteratively fuses demonstrations to improve diversity without human labeling. 

Key Details:
- FUSED samples and fuses demonstrations from previous iterations, ensuring new demonstrations are different from old ones. This enhances diversity over iterations.
- Evaluated on Spider and KaggleDBQA datasets. Brings average gains of 3.2% and 5.0% over baselines with and without human labeling.

Main Contributions:  
- First work to formally analyze insufficient diversity of human-labeled text-to-SQL demonstrations.
- Propose metric to measure diversity and show labeling data has insufficient diversity.
- Present FUSED method to iteratively fuse demonstrations and improve diversity without human labeling.
- Achieve significant gains over baselines on Spider and KaggleDBQA datasets, proving effectiveness.
