## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Decoding text from non-invasive brain recordings has potential for augmentative communication applications, but prior work has been limited to small, closed vocabularies. 
- Challenges include high-dimensionality and subjectivity of EEG signals and difficulties with language decoding capabilities of models.
- Evaluation metrics used so far focus on syntax and do not adequately capture semantics and human comprehensibility.

Proposed Solution:
- An end-to-end deep learning architecture for open vocabulary EEG-to-text decoding, consisting of:
   - A subject-dependent representation learning module to encode raw EEG signals
   - A BART language model module for sequence generation
   - A GPT-4 module for sentence refinement
- Uses BERTScore metric to assess semantic similarity and human understanding at sentence level
- Conducts ablation studies to analyze contributions of each module

Evaluated on ZuCo EEG dataset from reading tasks, comparing to prior state-of-the-art methods.

Main Contributions:
- Architecture with EEG representation learning and language modules enhances decoding performance and comprehensibility 
- Subject layer accounts for subjectivity in EEG signals
- BERTScore provides more comprehensive evaluation aligned with human judgment
- Ablation study validates efficacy of proposed modules and provides insights
- Significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art on ZuCo dataset across metrics, advancing progress in non-invasive EEG decoding through integration of modern techniques

The summary covers the key elements of the paper including the problem being addressed, an overview of the proposed solution and architecture, the evaluation approach and datasets used, the main contributions made compared to prior work, and the performance improvements achieved. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
