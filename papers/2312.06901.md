# [Unsupervised Extractive Summarization with Learnable Length Control   Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06901)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the classical knapsack problem (KP) and a variant called the k-item knapsack problem (kKP). 
- In KP, given a set of items with weights and profits, and a knapsack capacity, the goal is to select a subset of items with maximum profit whose total weight does not exceed the knapsack capacity. 
- kKP adds an extra constraint of an upper bound k on the number of items that can be selected.

Proposed Solutions:
- The paper proposes novel rounding techniques that combine arithmetic and geometric rounding in powerful ways not used before. 
- Using these techniques, the paper presents:
  - A polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for kKP that runs in O(n + k*(1/ɛ)^(1/ɛ)) time and linear space. This is a substantial improvement over prior best bound of O(n^(1/ɛ)).
  - A faster fully PTAS for kKP running in O(n + k/ɛ^4 + 1/ɛ^5) time and O(n + 1/ɛ^4) space.

Main Contributions:
- First application of combined arithmetic and geometric rounding techniques for approximation algorithms.
- Linear time PTAS for kKP, significantly improving upon previous best polynomial bound.
- Faster FPTAS for kKP with running time and space complexity bounds independent of the number of items n.
- The techniques can also be applied to speed up existing schemes for the classical KP problem.
- Provides powerful new rounding tools for designing approximation schemes.

In summary, the paper makes important theoretical contributions regarding designing of efficient approximation schemes by inventing novel rounding techniques. It also gives the best known schemes for both kKP and KP in terms of time complexity.
