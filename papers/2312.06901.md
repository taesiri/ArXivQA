# [Unsupervised Extractive Summarization with Learnable Length Control   Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06901)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents novel techniques for approximating solutions to the NP-hard knapsack problem by combining arithmetic and geometric rounding. The authors provide an improved polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the k-item knapsack problem that runs in O(n + k(1/ε)^O(1/ε)) time and linear space, substantially faster than prior algorithms. They also present a faster fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) running in O(n + k/ε^4 + 1/ε^5) time and O(n + 1/ε^4) space. A key insight is that appropriate combinations of arithmetic and geometric rounding, techniques commonly used individually, can yield more powerful approximations when used together. The authors show both theoretically and empirically that clever mixed rounding strategies can dramatically reduce running times for approximation algorithms while still guaranteeing near-optimal solutions. This demonstrates the potential for hybrid techniques to enable efficient solutions to intractable problems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents novel rounding techniques that combine arithmetic and geometric rounding to develop improved polynomial-time approximation schemes for the knapsack problem with cardinality constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting new rounding techniques for approximating the knapsack problem by appropriately combining arithmetic and geometric rounding. Specifically:

- The paper shows that combining arithmetic and geometric rounding techniques in "parallel" yields a reduced set of items that allows constructing near-optimal solutions. This leads to a linear-space PTAS for the k-item knapsack problem with running time O(n + k*(1/ε)^(O(1/ε))).

- The paper also presents a "serial" combination of geometric and arithmetic rounding to obtain an improved FPTAS for the k-item knapsack problem, with running time O(n + k/ε^4 + 1/ε^5) and space complexity O(n + 1/ε^4). 

So in summary, the key innovation is using novel combinations of existing rounding techniques to develop faster approximation schemes for the knapsack problem, including the first linear-time PTAS and an improved FPTAS. The analysis shows these hybrid rounding methods provide substantial improvements over prior approaches.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Knapsack problem (KP) - The classical combinatorial optimization problem of choosing a subset of items that maximizes profit without exceeding a weight capacity.

- k-item knapsack problem (kKP) - A variant of KP with an additional cardinality constraint on the number of items selected. 

- Approximation algorithms - Algorithms that find near-optimal solutions to hard combinatorial problems like KP.

- Polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) - An approximation algorithm that can find a solution within a factor 1-ε of optimal in polynomial time for any ε>0.  

- Fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) - A PTAS with running time polynomial in both the input size and 1/ε.

- Rounding techniques - Methods for transforming or simplifying inputs to enable efficient approximation algorithms, like arithmetic and geometric rounding.

- Dynamic programming - An algorithm design technique based on breaking down problems into smaller subproblems. Used here in one of the FPTAS algorithms.

- Performance guarantee - The worst-case bound on the ratio of the algorithm's solution to the optimal solution.

So in summary, this paper focuses a lot on approximation algorithms, especially PTAS and FPTAS schemes, for knapsack problems using rounding techniques and dynamic programming.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes combining arithmetic and geometric rounding techniques as a novel way to obtain better approximations for the knapsack problem. What is the intuition behind why this combined approach works better than using just one type of rounding? 

2. When doing the arithmetic rounding, the number of items is bounded using integrals/summations. Could you explain the derivation of these bounds in more detail? How tight are these bounds?

3. For the dynamic programming algorithm on the large items, what determines the choice of breaking point λ between small and large profits? Is there an optimal way to choose this threshold? 

4. The proof that the mapping between Sε^d and Rε^d is one-to-one for rational ε is quite technical. Could you provide some additional intuition about why this result holds?

5. When analyzing the geometric rounding, the paper relates the solution space to volumes of simplices and tetrahedrons. Why is this specific geometric approach useful for obtaining a lower bound?

6. The serial geometric & arithmetic rounding technique is proposed to reduce the dependencies on 1/ε. What would the time complexity be if only arithmetic or only geometric rounding was used?

7. For the PTAS, the choice of parameters k and l is important. How should these be tuned as a function of ε to optimize the overall algorithm performance?

8. The paper claims the space complexity required is linear, but dynamic programming tends to require more space. So how does the algorithm only need linear space?

9. For implementations in practice, are there ways the hidden constants or lower order terms in the time complexities could be reduced further? 

10. The techniques rely on rounding item profits. Would the approaches still work if instead weights were rounded? What difficulties might arise?
