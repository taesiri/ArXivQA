# [Unsupervised Extractive Summarization with Learnable Length Control   Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06901)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the classical knapsack problem (KP) and a variant called the k-item knapsack problem (kKP). 
- In KP, given a set of items with weights and profits, and a knapsack capacity, the goal is to select a subset of items with maximum profit whose total weight does not exceed the knapsack capacity. 
- kKP adds an extra constraint of an upper bound k on the number of items that can be selected.

Proposed Solutions:
- The paper proposes novel rounding techniques that combine arithmetic and geometric rounding in powerful ways not used before. 
- Using these techniques, the paper presents:
  - A polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for kKP that runs in O(n + k*(1/ɛ)^(1/ɛ)) time and linear space. This is a substantial improvement over prior best bound of O(n^(1/ɛ)).
  - A faster fully PTAS for kKP running in O(n + k/ɛ^4 + 1/ɛ^5) time and O(n + 1/ɛ^4) space.

Main Contributions:
- First application of combined arithmetic and geometric rounding techniques for approximation algorithms.
- Linear time PTAS for kKP, significantly improving upon previous best polynomial bound.
- Faster FPTAS for kKP with running time and space complexity bounds independent of the number of items n.
- The techniques can also be applied to speed up existing schemes for the classical KP problem.
- Provides powerful new rounding tools for designing approximation schemes.

In summary, the paper makes important theoretical contributions regarding designing of efficient approximation schemes by inventing novel rounding techniques. It also gives the best known schemes for both kKP and KP in terms of time complexity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents novel rounding techniques that combine arithmetic and geometric rounding to develop improved polynomial-time approximation schemes for the knapsack problem with cardinality constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting novel combinations of rounding techniques to develop improved approximation algorithms for the knapsack problem and its variant with a cardinality constraint (k-item knapsack problem). Specifically:

- The paper shows that appropriate combinations of arithmetic and geometric rounding yields powerful new rounding methods. This is in contrast to previous work that relied on either arithmetic or geometric rounding alone. 

- Using these rounding techniques, the paper presents:

1) A linear-time PTAS (polynomial time approximation scheme) for the k-item knapsack problem that requires only linear space. This is an improvement over the previous best polynomial time bound.

2) A faster FPTAS (fully polynomial time approximation scheme) for the k-item knapsack problem running in O(n+k/ε^4+1/ε^5) time.

So in summary, the key contribution is using creative combinations of rounding techniques to develop approximation algorithms for knapsack problems that improve upon previous theoretical bounds. The techniques could also inspire approximations algorithms for other discrete optimization problems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes combining arithmetic and geometric rounding techniques for the knapsack problem. Why is arithmetic rounding alone not sufficient and what does adding geometric rounding achieve? 

2. The analysis shows the number of items after parallel arithmetic and geometric rounding is O(γ/ε). Walk through the key steps that derive this bound. Where does the logarithmic dependence come from?

3. Explain why naively applying dynamic programming after geometric rounding results in an exponential time algorithm. What insight allowed the authors to avoid this?

4. Walk through the proof of Theorem 1 step-by-step. What is the intuition behind relating the rounded profit values to the volume of a tetrahedron? 

5. The serial geometric and arithmetic rounding technique is crucial for the FPTAS. Explain why applying arithmetic rounding on top of geometric rounding allows the dynamic programming to remain polynomial.

6. What is the high-level intuition behind separating items into large and small items for the FPTAS? Why can small items be handled less rigorously than large items?

7. The paper shows carefully that the number of possible rounded profit values is still pseudopolynomial after rounding. Walk through the counting argument in Lemma 1 and why it is necessary. 

8. Explain intuitively why the runtime of the FPTAS has terms for n, k, and 1/ε. What practical considerations do these terms capture?

9. How would parallelization impact the efficiency and runtime analysis of the proposed schemes? What are the conceptual bottlenecks?

10. Can the techniques proposed in this paper be extended to related problems like multidimensional knapsack? Identify challenges that may arise.
