## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in zero-shot learning:

- Dataset: It evaluates methods on several standard datasets like SUN, CUB, AWA, aPY, and ImageNet. Many other papers focus evaluation on just 1-2 datasets. Using multiple datasets provides a more comprehensive comparison.

- Methods: It evaluates 10 recent zero-shot learning methods, which is a fairly extensive list compared to most works that typically compare just 2-5 methods. Evaluating a large number of methods provides a good overview of the state-of-the-art.

- Evaluation protocol: The paper proposes a unified evaluation protocol with new train/val/test splits to enable fair comparison. Many works use different protocols, which makes comparisons unreliable. Enforcing a common protocol is an important contribution. 

- Metrics: The use of per-class accuracy and harmonic mean for imbalanced datasets is an improvement over basic per-image accuracy used in some works. These metrics better measure real performance.

- Tasks: It evaluates both standard zero-shot learning and the more realistic generalized zero-shot setting. Many works still only evaluate standard ZSL.

- Analysis: The paper provides in-depth analysis like statistical tests, robustness checks, and ranking visualizations. This level of rigorous analysis is rare to see but provides valuable insights.

Overall, the extensive experiments and detailed analysis make this one of the most thorough comparisons of zero-shot learning methods to date. The effort to unify evaluation protocols is an important step for the field. This paper provides a "good, bad, and ugly" view of the status quo of zero-shot learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the paper suggest several future research directions:

- Developing new zero-shot learning methods that can improve performance on large-scale datasets like ImageNet. The paper showed that current methods still perform poorly when scaled to thousands of classes.

- Designing generalized zero-shot learning methods that can achieve high accuracy on both seen and unseen classes. The paper showed a discrepancy where some methods do well on seen classes but poorly on unseen classes, and vice versa. New methods need to balance performance on both.

- Leveraging unlabeled data more effectively for transductive zero-shot learning. The paper showed mixed results from using unlabeled data, so better ways to exploit this could improve performance.

- Evaluating the effect of different class embeddings like attributes, Word2Vec, etc. The choice of embedding seemed to impact performance but was not systematically analyzed. 

- Adding calibration methods to zero-shot learning to get probabilistic or confidence-rated predictions. The raw scores may not reflect true class probabilities.

- Developing zero-shot learning for more complex tasks like detection, segmentation, action recognition, etc. Most work has focused on image classification.

- Enabling zero-shot learning in real-world applications where labeled data is scarce. Progress has been benchmark-driven so translating that to practice is important.

In summary, scaling zero-shot learning, improving generalized zero-shot learning, better use of unlabeled data, analysis of embeddings, calibration, new tasks, and real-world deployment are highlighted as promising directions for advancing the field. The paper provides a set of recommendations to build on the current state-of-the-art.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of zero-shot learning methods on several datasets. Zero-shot learning aims to classify images of classes not seen during training, by leveraging auxiliary information like attributes or word embeddings. The paper argues that previously proposed zero-shot learning benchmarks lack standardized evaluation protocols and may even contain flawed experimental setups. To address this, the authors unify evaluation protocols and propose new splits for several datasets, ensuring no test classes overlap with Imagenet-1K used to train image features. They introduce a new dataset called Animals with Attributes 2 (AWA2) with different images but same classes/attributes as existing AWA1. The paper extensively compares and analyzes various recent zero-shot learning methods on these datasets in both classic zero-shot and generalized zero-shot settings. The evaluation finds that generative models and compatibility learning frameworks perform best, while methods learning independent attribute/object classifiers are weaker. The authors emphasize proper validation splits, measuring per-class accuracy, and including seen classes at test time in generalized zero-shot learning. They discuss limitations of current methods and provide insights into advancing the field.

In summary, this paper provides the most extensive benchmark of zero-shot learning methods by unifying evaluation protocols and datasets. It analyzes performance of many recent models in depth, revealing strengths of generative and compatibility learning approaches. The benchmark enables standardized assessment, while the analyses give insights into limitations and future directions. The introduction of the AWA2 dataset also facilitates further research. Through this thorough evaluation and critique, the paper makes an important contribution towards advancing the state-of-the-art in zero-shot learning.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of zero-shot learning methods on several datasets. The authors argue that there is no agreed upon zero-shot learning benchmark, so they propose a unified evaluation protocol and new splits for several datasets to ensure a fair comparison. They introduce a new dataset called Animals with Attributes 2 (AWA2) with images licensed for redistribution to enable future vision research. The paper compares many state-of-the-art zero-shot learning methods in depth in the classic zero-shot setting and the more realistic generalized zero-shot setting. The methods encompass linear and nonlinear compatibility learning frameworks, independent attribute classifier learning, and hybrid models. Evaluation is performed on small to large-scale datasets including SUN, CUB, AWA1, AWA2, aPY, and ImageNet.

They emphasize the importance of tuning hyperparameters on a validation set disjoint from the training set. The new AWA2 dataset is shown to be compatible with AWA1 for cross-dataset evaluation. For generalized zero-shot learning, the accuracy on both training and test classes should be optimized, rather than just test classes. The work comprehensively analyzes the current status quo of zero-shot learning and provides insights to advance the field.
