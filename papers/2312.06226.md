## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called IRSS (Invariant Representation Learning via Decoupling Style and Spurious Features) to address the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem in image classification when both style distribution shifts and spurious features are present, without requiring domain labels. The key idea is to explicitly model style features and spurious features separately in a structural causal model of image generation. Based on this, IRSS incorporates adversarial learning to align style distributions across domains and multi-environment learning to eliminate the influence of spurious features. Specifically, it extracts style-discriminative features to reassign style labels, then applies adversarial learning to align distributions across different styles. It also clusters the learned feature representations to identify environments with different spurious features and applies invariant risk minimization to eliminate their influence. Experiments on PACS, OfficeHome and NICO datasets demonstrate that IRSS outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization methods by decoupling the entangled style and spurious features. The ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component. IRSS provides an effective approach to learn invariant representations when complex distribution shifts exist.
