## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the challenge of effectively transforming complex machine learning (ML) task descriptions specified in natural language into executable code. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled progress in code generation, there remains a gap in converting intricate ML narratives into structured code components tailored to the specific requirements of ML workflows. 

Proposed Solution - Linguacodus Framework
The paper proposes Linguacodus, an innovative framework to tackle this challenge through a dynamic two-phase pipeline:

Phase 1 - Controlled Transformation into Solution Instructions
- Leverages GPT-3.5 to extract high-level ML instructions from existing solutions, ranked by quality.
- Fine-tunes Llama-2 model on dataset of ML task descriptions paired with extracted instructions.
- Selects top 3 most pertinent instructions via Llama-2 inference. 
- Further refines instructions through multi-agent GPT to choose best option.

Phase 2 - Instruction-based Code Generation
- Transforms refined instructions into modular code segments for data preprocessing, model architecture, training etc.
- Integrates code components and fixes errors iteratively using GPT-3.5.

Key Contributions
- Presents a structured framework to translate ML tasks into precise instructions and ultimately into executable code.
- Demonstrates a technique to enhance control and specificity in code generation using ranked instructions.  
- Validates approach via experiments on unseen Kaggle problems; generated code is compilable and aligns well with evaluation metrics.
- Showcases potential to make ML development more efficient and accessible to wider audiences.

In summary, Linguacodus offers an effective solution through controlled instruction-based transformation to address limitations in converting complex ML descriptions into functional code tailored to specialized workflows.
