# [Is It Possible to Backdoor Face Forgery Detection with Natural Triggers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00414)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Face forgery detection models based on deep neural networks have shown remarkable performance in discriminating between real and artificially generated fake faces. However, their security is significantly threatened by backdoor attacks which inject triggers during model training. Existing backdoor attacks mainly use visible triggers like patches or perturbations, which can be defended against. More challenging natural backdoor triggers that utilize semantic image features remain under-explored. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel backdoor attack that embeds natural triggers in the latent space of generative models. The attack is studied from two perspectives:

1. Model Discrimination: An optimization method finds triggers by minimizing the loss of classifying generated poisoned images as real on a substitute model.

2. Data Distribution: It manipulates facial attributes in the long tail of training data distribution to create triggers. Both single attribute (e.g. smile) and multiple attributes (e.g. smile and age) are edited to generate custom triggers.

The triggers are embedded in the latent codes of StyleGAN and Stable Diffusion to create poisoned samples. After model training with poisoned data, images generated with triggers bypass detection while images without triggers are still correctly classified.

Main Contributions:

- Proposal of a novel natural backdoor attack against face forgery detection by embedding triggers in latent space
- Demonstration of higher attack success rate, lower detectability, and more robustness compared to existing attacks
- Revealing the vulnerability of face forgery detection models to backdoor attacks with natural triggers
- Extension of the attack framework to both GANs (StyleGAN) and diffusion models (Stable Diffusion)

The attack causes negligible accuracy drop on clean data while achieving over 99% attack success rate with less than 3% poisoning. It is also more resistant to defenses and less perceptible than existing attacks. The work thoroughly evaluates and reveals the vulnerability of face forgery detection systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel backdoor attack against face forgery detection models by embedding natural triggers in the latent space, obtained either through optimization or by manipulating uncommon facial attributes, which achieves high attack success rate while being stealthy and robust to defenses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel natural backdoor attack against face forgery detection models by embedding the trigger in the latent space from two perspectives: model discrimination (optimization-based triggers) and data distribution (custom triggers).

2. Extensive experiments demonstrating that the proposed natural triggers are more imperceptible and more robust to various defenses compared to previous attack methods. 

3. Thoroughly revealing the vulnerability of face forgery detection against backdoor attacks, which provides insights to improve the security of face forgery detection.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a new type of stealthy and robust backdoor attack using natural triggers against face forgery detection, evaluating it extensively, and revealing the vulnerability of detection models to stimulate future research on improving security.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two perspectives to generate natural backdoor triggers - model discrimination and data distribution. Can you explain the key differences between these two perspectives? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?

2. For the optimization-based trigger generation, the paper uses a substitute model trained on substitute data. How does using a substitute model instead of the victim model impact the attack? What considerations should be made in selecting the architecture and training data for the substitute model? 

3. The custom trigger manipulates facial attributes following a long-tail distribution. Why is it important to select less common attributes? How does the choice of attributes impact attack success rate, benign accuracy, and stealthiness?

4. The paper embeds triggers into the latent space of generative models. What are the main challenges in manipulating the latent space compared to the pixel space? How does the paper address potential issues like latent space entanglement?

5. For StyleGAN, triggers are embedded in the W space. For Stable Diffusion, triggers are embedded in the text prompt embedding space. What are the trade-offs between these two embedding strategies? Which space allows more control over trigger attributes?

6. When applying custom triggers to Stable Diffusion, the paper adds different single-attribute triggers in different denoising steps. Why is this multi-step approach used instead of adding all attributes in one step? How does this impact image quality and attack success?

7. The results show high attack success rates but slightly lower numbers compared to some baseline attacks. Why does the proposed attack have this characteristic? What could be done to further increase attack success rates?

8. The paper demonstrates superior robustness against several backdoor defenses like STRIP, Neural Cleanse and Fine-Pruning. Between optimization-based and custom triggers, which one tends to be more resistant and why?

9. User studies reveal the proposed attack generates more imperceptible poisoned samples than baselines. What semantic features allow the attack to achieve better stealthiness compared to other approaches? 

10. The method establishes a general framework for backdooring face forgery detection models. How could the framework be extended to other generative models and conditional image synthesis techniques? What challenges may arise?
