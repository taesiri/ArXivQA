## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "A New Learning Paradigm for Foundation Model-based Remote Sensing Change Detection":

Problem:
- Change detection (CD) is an important task for analyzing land cover changes in remote sensing images. While deep learning models have made progress, their performance is constrained by limited labeled data. 
- On the other hand, recently emerged "foundation models" trained on huge datasets have impressive generalization abilities. However, it is non-trivial to transfer their knowledge to the CD task due to domain gap and different input structure.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes the Bi-Temporal Adapter Network (BAN), a universal framework to adapt foundation models for the CD task. 
- BAN contains three components: 1) a frozen foundation model (e.g. CLIP) that extracts general visual features, 2) a Bi-Temporal Adapter Branch (Bi-TAB) that is a CD model to extract task-specific features, and 3) bridging modules to select, align and inject general knowledge into the Bi-TAB.
- An Asymmetric Resolution Input Strategy (ARIS) is used to handle different resolutions of foundation model and Bi-TAB.
- Bi-TAB can be any existing CD model in a plug-and-play fashion, making BAN model-agnostic.

Main Contributions:
- BAN reduces labeled data dependence of CD models by reusing general knowledge in foundation models, using a side-tuning approach. To the best of knowledge, it is the first framework to adapt foundation models for CD.
- The bridging modules effectively transfer selected knowledge from foundation model to Bi-TAB in a cross-domain manner.
- Experiments show BAN brings average 4.08% IoU improvements for existing CD methods, using only a few additional parameters. It also has better cross-domain generalization.
- The model-agnostic Bi-TAB concept and strong performance confirm the potential of foundation models for remote sensing CD tasks.
