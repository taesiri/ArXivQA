# [Plateau-reduced Differentiable Path Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17263)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we alleviate plateaus (regions of zero gradient) in the objective function when doing inverse rendering, in order to enable the optimization of more complex light transport effects?

The key hypothesis appears to be that convolving the high-dimensional rendering function with an additional kernel that blurs the parameter space will reduce plateaus and lead to better optimization performance.

In summary, the paper is investigating methods to reduce plateaus in the objective function during inverse rendering, in order to optimize problems involving effects like global illumination, caustics, etc. that existent differentiable renderers struggle to converge on. The proposed approach is to convolve the rendering equation with a smoothing kernel over the parameter space.
