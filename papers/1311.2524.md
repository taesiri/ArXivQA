# [Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic   segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

To what extent do convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on image classification generalize to object detection tasks? 

The key hypothesis is that CNNs can dramatically improve object detection performance on standard datasets compared to previous approaches relying on hand-crafted features like SIFT and HOG.

To test this, the paper proposes a method called R-CNN that combines CNN features computed on region proposals with class-specific linear SVMs to localize and classify objects. The main innovations are:

1) Using CNNs on region proposals for localization rather than a sliding window approach.

2) Supervised pre-training of the CNN on a large dataset (ImageNet classification) followed by fine-tuning on the target detection dataset.

The paper shows R-CNN significantly outperforms prior detection methods like DPM and achieves state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC and ILSVRC2013 detection. This supports the hypothesis that CNNs can generalize well from classification to detection tasks given an effective training strategy.

In summary, the key question is whether CNNs can improve detection over hand-crafted features, which is demonstrated through the proposed R-CNN method and experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Proposing a simple and scalable object detection algorithm called R-CNN (Regions with CNN features) that achieves substantially higher accuracy on the PASCAL VOC detection benchmark compared to prior methods. The R-CNN method improves mean average precision (mAP) by over 30% relative to previous best results on VOC 2012.

2. Demonstrating that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can lead to dramatically improved object detection performance compared to systems relying on simpler hand-crafted features like SIFT or HOG. 

3. Introducing a paradigm of using supervised pre-training on a large auxiliary dataset (ImageNet classification), followed by domain-specific fine-tuning on the target detection dataset to effectively train high-capacity CNNs when detection data is scarce. This pre-training/fine-tuning approach improves mAP by 8 percentage points.

4. Showing competitive semantic segmentation results by extending R-CNN to this task, achieving 47.9% segmentation accuracy on VOC 2011.

5. Providing visualization and analysis of the learned CNN features and common failure modes of R-CNN, including a simple bounding box regression method to reduce localization errors.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be presenting R-CNN, a simple yet effective region-based CNN approach for object detection, and showing it significantly outperforms prior detection systems on benchmark datasets. The paper also demonstrates the potential of CNNs for detection and segmentation tasks, and introduces pre-training/fine-tuning for learning high-capacity CNNs when data is limited.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called R-CNN that achieves state-of-the-art object detection performance by combining region proposals with deep convolutional neural networks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in object detection:

- It demonstrates the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object detection on complex datasets like PASCAL VOC. At the time, most top detection systems relied on hand-engineered features like SIFT and HOG rather than learned features from CNNs. This paper helped drive wider adoption of CNNs.

- The R-CNN system operates on region proposals rather than a sliding window approach. This was an important design decision that allowed the system to apply high-capacity CNNs pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet. Other region-based detectors existed, but R-CNN showed how powerful deep learned features could be in this paradigm.

- The paper emphasizes supervised pre-training on auxiliary datasets followed by domain-specific fine-tuning. This became a standard paradigm in many areas as researchers realized that CNNs pre-trained on ImageNet transferred well to new tasks/domains when fine-tuned appropriately.

- R-CNN achieves significantly higher accuracy than prior methods like DPMs with hand-crafted features. The gains are very large (over 30% relative mAP increase on VOC). This highlighted the potential for learned deep features to surpass hand-engineered ones.

- The system achieves high accuracy while still being efficient by sharing computation in the CNN across classes. This helped drive further adoption of CNNs in detection.

So in summary, this paper made critical contributions in demonstrating the effectiveness of CNNs, transfer learning, and region-based detection for object recognition. It helped catalyze a shift to learned deep features and achieve large accuracy gains on benchmarks like PASCAL VOC.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving region proposal methods to increase recall and better handle scale invariance. The authors note room for improvement here, as the recall on ILSVRC was lower than on PASCAL VOC.

- Speeding up R-CNN, potentially by sharing computation across overlapping windows like OverFeat does. The authors note R-CNN is slower than OverFeat currently.

- Simplifying the training pipeline by removing the need to train SVMs after fine-tuning the CNN. The authors suggest with additional tweaks to fine-tuning, the SVM training may be unnecessary.

- Applying the "supervised pre-training + fine-tuning" paradigm to other data-scarce vision tasks. The authors propose this is a generalizable approach for problems with limited training data.

- Exploring use of the convolutional layers of the CNN as a dense feature extractor, to enable experimentation with sliding-window detectors on top of the conv feature maps.

- Further analysis of the learned convolutional features to better understand what the network has learned. The authors provide some visualizations but more investigation could be done.

- Extending R-CNN to additional recognition tasks like scene classification, fine-grained categorization, etc, since it provides a general region-based feature extractor.

So in summary, the main directions seem to be improving the region proposals, speeding up the system, simplifying the training, applying the approach to new tasks, and further analysis of the learned features.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an object detection system called R-CNN that achieves significantly higher performance on the PASCAL VOC detection challenge compared to prior methods. The key ideas are 1) Using region proposals instead of sliding windows to localize objects in the image. 2) Extracting features from each region proposal using a large convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on image classification. 3) Fine-tuning the CNN on the target detection dataset to learn domain-specific features. Without fine-tuning, R-CNN achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 47.3% on PASCAL VOC 2007. With fine-tuning, performance is boosted dramatically to 54.2% mAP. The fine-tuned R-CNN also outperforms the OverFeat sliding-window detector, achieving 31.4% mAP on the ILSVRC 2013 detection dataset compared to OverFeat's 24.3% mAP. Additionally, with minor modifications R-CNN achieves competitive performance on semantic segmentation, obtaining 47.9% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2011. Overall, the paper shows that CNN features learned for image classification can effectively transfer to localization tasks like detection and segmentation when combined with region proposals. Fine-tuning the CNN on these tasks gives significant performance gains over using the CNN as a black-box feature extractor.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an object detection system called R-CNN that achieves significantly higher detection performance on the PASCAL VOC dataset compared to prior methods. The system has three main components: 1) It generates region proposals using selective search. 2) A large pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts a fixed-length feature vector from each region. 3) The features are fed into a set of class-specific linear SVMs for classification. 

The key insights enabling R-CNN's performance are: 1) Applying high-capacity CNNs to bottom-up region proposals to localize and segment objects, rather than using a sliding window approach. 2) Using supervised pre-training of the CNN on a large auxiliary dataset (ImageNet classification) followed by fine-tuning on the target detection dataset. This allows the CNN to be trained despite scarce labeled detection data. R-CNN achieves a mean average precision of 53.7% on PASCAL VOC 2010 compared to 35.1% for the same region proposals with a bag-of-visual-words approach. It also significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on the ILSVRC2013 detection dataset.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method called R-CNN for object detection that combines region proposals with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 

The main idea is to first generate category-independent region proposals from the input image using an algorithm like Selective Search. Then a CNN feature extractor is applied to each proposal to obtain a fixed-length feature vector. Finally, the feature vectors are classified using linear SVMs for each object category. 

At test time, around 2000 region proposals are generated per image. Each proposal is warped to a fixed 227x227 size and passed through the CNN to extract features. The features are classified with the SVMs and non-maximum suppression is applied to detect objects.

The CNN is pre-trained on ImageNet for classification and then fine-tuned on the target detection dataset like PASCAL VOC. This allows the high-capacity CNN model to be trained despite having limited labeled detection data.

The method achieves high object detection performance, improving mean average precision by over 30% relative to the previous best result on PASCAL VOC 2012 at the time. It also outperforms the OverFeat sliding-window detector on ILSVRC 2013 detection. The CNN features are shown to be much more informative than hand-crafted features like HOG.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the issue of object detection performance plateauing in recent years when evaluated on the PASCAL VOC dataset. The best performing methods were complex ensemble systems combining multiple low-level image features and high-level context, but progress had stalled. 

The key questions the paper seeks to address are:

1) Can convolutional neural networks (CNNs) lead to dramatically higher object detection performance on PASCAL VOC compared to systems based on simpler HOG-like features? 

2) How can you train a high-capacity CNN model when only a small quantity of annotated detection data is available?

To summarize, the paper aims to show that CNNs can substantially improve object detection on PASCAL VOC and presents methods to effectively train these CNNs with limited labeled detection data. The two key ideas are:

1) Applying high-capacity CNNs to bottom-up region proposals to localize and segment objects.

2) Using supervised pre-training on a large dataset (ImageNet classification) followed by domain-specific fine-tuning on the smaller target dataset (PASCAL VOC detection) to learn the CNN.

By combining these insights, the paper shows major improvements in object detection performance on PASCAL VOC over prior state-of-the-art approaches.
