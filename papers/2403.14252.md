# [LayoutLLM: Large Language Model Instruction Tuning for Visually Rich   Document Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14252)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Visually rich document understanding (VrDU) tasks like document classification and information extraction are important but challenging as they require understanding both textual and visual information. 
- Existing VrDU methods require fine-tuning for each task and dataset which is expensive. They also cannot handle natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
- Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but cannot handle document images.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose LayoutLLM which combines a VrDU model as encoder and LLM as decoder into one model.
- Use LayoutLMv3 to encode document images and capture layout and text.
- Use Llama LLM to decode instructions, analyze text, and output responses.
- Fine-tune the model on VrDU tasks using document images and task prompts. Also fine-tune on NLP tasks.

Key Contributions:
- LayoutLLM allows performing various VrDU and NLP tasks in a single model via instruction tuning.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art on document classification, information extraction and question answering.
- Shows improved ability to handle NLP tasks compared to using LLM alone.
- Provides a flexible framework to incorporate better VrDU encoders in the future.

In summary, the paper proposes LayoutLLM which combines strengths of VrDU and LLMs to perform multi-task understanding of documents in a simple and flexible way, outperforming prior specialized models.
