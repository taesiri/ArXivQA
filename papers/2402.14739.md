# [Autonomy Oriented Digital Twins for Real2Sim2Real Autoware Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14739)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper presents a framework for developing digital twins of autonomous vehicles across different scales and integrating them with the open-source Autoware software stack. The goal is to enable streamlined development and deployment of autonomy algorithms from simulation to reality (sim2real). 

The key motivation is that while simulations play a crucial role in autonomous vehicle development, creating high-fidelity models that accurately capture real-world physics and allow real-time interactivity remains challenging. Recent advances in online deep learning for system identification and adaptive modeling facilitate the transition from static "virtual prototypes" to dynamic, adaptable "digital twins" that improve simulation fidelity and better bridge the sim2real gap.

The core contribution is integrating the Autoware stack with the AutoDRIVE Ecosystem, a toolkit for developing digital twins. This is demonstrated through end-to-end autonomous driving tasks of mapping an unknown environment, recording a trajectory, and tracking it. Deployments span small (Nigel, F1TENTH), mid (Hunter SE) and full (OpenCAV) scale vehicles in on-road and off-road environments. Notably, this enables the first off-road deployment of Autoware.

Additional contributions include developing accurate vehicle and environment models using the AutoDRIVE Simulator, with validation against real-world data. Flexible APIs (Python, C++, ROS, ROS 2) and HMIs are implemented to interface with digital and physical vehicles. Custom Autoware packages are created to handle different platforms. A technique to use lightweight 2D maps instead of heavy 3D point clouds is presented.

The framework aims to enhance functionality, adaptability and safety of autonomous systems. Future work includes multi-agent coordination, dynamic replanning for better efficiency and safety, and further simulation-to-reality transfer across scales.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents the development and integration of digital twins across vehicle scales to enable Autoware deployments for autonomous navigation in simulated and real-world environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is the integration of the Autoware stack with the AutoDRIVE Ecosystem to demonstrate end-to-end autonomy using vehicles across different scales - small-scale (Nigel and F1TENTH), mid-scale (Hunter SE), and full-scale (OpenCAV). Specifically, the paper shows how Autoware can be used for mapping an unknown environment, recording a trajectory within the mapped environment, and then autonomously tracking the pre-recorded trajectory. This is demonstrated both in simulation using digital twins developed in AutoDRIVE Ecosystem, as well as on real small-scale vehicles like Nigel and F1TENTH. The paper also discusses novel contributions like adding trajectory looping capability and operational modes in Autoware, custom meta-packages for different vehicles, and converting 3D point cloud data to 2D for computational efficiency. Overall, the main contribution is using AutoDRIVE Ecosystem and Autoware together to enable scalable autonomy via digital twins and sim2real transfer learning.
