# [Bayesian Semi-structured Subspace Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12950)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Semi-structured regression (SSR) models combine interpretable structured models (e.g. linear models) with flexible deep neural networks (DNNs). This allows modeling both simple interpretable effects as well as complex unstructured effects.
- However, SSR models struggle with uncertainty quantification, especially epistemic uncertainty coming from the DNN component. Existing methods either ignore the DNN uncertainty or assume it to be given.
- Another challenge is the asymmetry during optimization between the structured and DNN components due to their fundamentally different nature.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Bayesian approximation method called "semi-structured subspace inference" for uncertainty quantification in SSR models.  
- It extends subspace inference to jointly sample from a full posterior over the structured parameters and a compressed subspace posterior over the DNN weights.
- The subspace is constructed to capture multiple minima and low-loss regions between independently trained solutions. This allows exploring diverse good solutions.
- Sampling is done efficiently in this subspace while retaining full flexibility for the structured parameters.
- A temperature parameter is introduced to scale the DNN likelihood without affecting the marginal posterior of the structured parameters.

Main Contributions:
- First method to quantify uncertainty in both structured and DNN components of SSR models in a Bayesian manner.
- Subspace inference approach captures multiple modes and traverses along low-loss valleys.
- Structured parameters are sampled from full space allowing accurate posteriors.
- Approach alleviates optimization asymmetry in SSR models.
- Experiments show the method recovers accurate structured parameter posteriors, approaches MCMC quality with enough subspace capacity, and achieves strong predictive performance.

In summary, the paper proposes a Bayesian subspace inference method for SSR models that can effectively quantify uncertainty in both model components while also addressing optimization challenges. Experiments validate the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a Bayesian approximation method for semi-structured regression models that allows for efficient posterior sampling and uncertainty quantification by using a hybrid sampling scheme with a full parameter space for structured effects and a tunable subspace approximation for unstructured neural network effects.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is presenting "semi-structured subspace inference", which is a sampling-based method for Bayesian approximation of semi-structured regression (SSR) models. The key aspects of their method are:

1) It allows capturing both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in SSR models by approximating the posterior distribution. This addresses a limitation of existing SSR methods which either do not account for uncertainty from the DNN part or assume it to be given. 

2) It uses an adjustable subspace approximation for the DNN part to make posterior sampling feasible using MCMC. This allows the method to scale to large DNNs.

3) It samples from the full space for the structured model parameters, ensuring accurate posterior inference. This is in contrast to naive approaches that constrain the structured parameter posterior.

4) The subspace construction accounts for multiple minima in the loss landscape and is aware of the impact of the structured part. This facilitates effective joint sampling.

5) It exhibits competitive predictive performance across simulated and real datasets compared to gold standard MCMC and outperforms other approximation methods.

In summary, the main contribution is a Bayesian approximation method for SSR models that captures epistemic uncertainty, uses a tailored subspace approach, and demonstrates strong empirical performance. The method addresses limitations of existing SSR and Bayesian approximation techniques.
