# [Harm Amplification in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01787)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-image (T2I) models can generate harmful representations even when users provide harmless input prompts, amplifying harm in a way that exposes users to unintended dangers.  
- There is no formal definition or methodology to measure this "harm amplification" phenomenon. This limits the ability to assess safety techniques and mitigate harm in T2I systems.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper formally defines harm amplification in T2I as occurring when the generated image reflects more severe harms than the text prompt.  
- Three statistical methods are introduced to quantify harm amplification by comparing text and image harm levels using safety classifiers and embedding models like CLIP.

Key Contributions:
- A formal definition of harm amplification for T2I models.
- Three quantitative methods to identify harm amplification instances by comparing text and image harm scores.
- An analysis of harm amplification rates on a large T2I dataset showing the methods can simulate real deployment.
- Identification of disproportionate sexual objectification harm amplification for images depicting perceived females.

Overall, the paper lays a foundation for understanding and measuring harm amplification in T2I systems. The proposed methods and definition enable assessment of safety techniques and can inform development of strategies to mitigate unintended harms. Key results show the amplification of gender stereotypes, highlighting the need to address harm disparities.
