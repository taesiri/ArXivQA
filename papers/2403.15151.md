# [RHINO-VR Experience: Teaching Mobile Robotics Concepts in an Interactive   Museum Exhibit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15151)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the issue that most people are not familiar with the underlying mechanisms of mobile robots and tend to be afraid of this unfamiliar technology (fear of autonomous robots and AI - FARAI). To reduce this fear, people need to increase their knowledge on the topic. The authors identify museums as a good place for people of all ages to voluntarily educate themselves. They present the tour guide robot RHINO, one of the first robots to autonomously interact with people in 1997. Today, RHINO is not functional anymore and has become a museum exhibit itself.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors develop an interactive virtual reality (VR) museum exhibit called RHINO-VR that allows visitors to experience the historical robot RHINO in a virtual recreation of the museum it was originally deployed in. In the VR environment, visitors can interact with RHINO by pointing to locations it should navigate to. Additional visitors can observe RHINO's actions on an external screen. The virtual RHINO uses algorithms like Markov localization, A* path planning and Dynamic Window Approach to autonomously navigate just like the real robot. Visitors are presented with explanatory texts and visualizations of the sensor data to learn about the functionality. The virtual environment is reconstructed from 3D scans to closely resemble the real museum.

Main Contributions:
- An interactive VR museum exhibit to explain basic mobile robotics concepts to visitors and reduce the fear of autonomous robots and AI
- A digital reconstruction of the historical 1997 deployment of RHINO in the museum environment to enhance visitor engagement 
- Implementation of navigation capabilities like the original RHINO
- Visualizations and texts to teach visitors about sensors, localization, path planning etc.
- An external view for other visitors to observe the VR user's interactions with RHINO
- Evaluation showing VR improved understanding of RHINO's functionality and visitors would recommend the exhibit
