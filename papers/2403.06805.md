# [On the Robustness of Lexicase Selection to Contradictory Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06805)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Lexicase selection is a state-of-the-art parent selection technique in evolutionary computation that performs well on many types of problems. However, it's unclear if it can reliably solve many-objective optimization problems with contradictory objectives. 

- Prior work showed mixed results on lexicase selection's ability to solve problems with contradictory objectives. This paper aims to develop theory to identify when lexicase can or cannot find Pareto-optimal solutions on such problems.

Methods:
- They designed a theoretical fitness function with maximally contradictory objectives, where improving one objective hurts all others. 

- They modeled lexicase selection on this fitness landscape mathematically. The model calculates the probability that lexicase selection will fail to find a Pareto-optimal solution.

- They also conducted reachability analyses from failed runs to determine if Pareto-optimal solutions were impossible to find or just very difficult to find.

Key Findings:
- There is a region of parameter space where lexicase selection provably cannot find Pareto-optimal solutions on this problem. This region satisfies an analytic inequality relating population size, dimension and other parameters.

- Outside of this region, lexicase selection succeeds at finding Pareto-optimal solutions, despite the presence of contradictory objectives. So it is surprisingly robust.

- ε-lexicase selection struggles more with contradictory objectives. Dynamically adjusting epsilon helps substantially with this issue.

- Reachability analyses reveal lexicase selection gets stuck in different ways than ε-lexicase selection on this problem.

Implications:
- Provides theory-backed guidelines on parameter selection for lexicase selection on many-objective problems.

- Suggests lexicase selection has potential as a general many-objective optimization technique, though ε-lexicase may be less generally applicable.

- Raises new questions about why ε-lexicase struggles more and how intense objective contradiction impacts performance.
