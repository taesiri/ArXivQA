- For instruction generation, it implements methods using chat data, corpus or knowledge graphs as seeds. 
- For selection, it offers various statistics-based and LM-based metrics.
- EasyInstruct aims to standardize and facilitate instruction processing research and development.

Main Contributions:
- EasyInstruct enables automated high-quality instruction data generation at scale using LLMs. 
- It reduces the need for expensive manual annotation.
- The modular design makes it easy for both novice and expert users to build customized instruction processing pipelines.  
- EasyInstruct helps promote further research by providing a standardized platform for developing and comparing instruction processing techniques.
- It is publicly available and actively maintained to incorporate the evolving needs of the LLM community.

In summary, EasyInstruct facilitates streamlined development of instruction processing capabilities to improve the tuning process for LLMs through automated quality instruction data generation and selection tools in an easy-to-use standardized platform.
