# [EasyInstruct: An Easy-to-use Instruction Processing Framework for Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03049)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Constructing high-quality, large-scale instructions is crucial for instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs), but remains challenging. 
- There is a lack of open-source tools for instruction processing to generate and select high-quality instructions.
- Existing instruction processing projects are often highly customized and lack modularized and standardized capabilities.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose EasyInstruct, an open-source instruction processing framework for LLMs. 
- It provides modularized capabilities for instruction generation, selection and prompting.
- For instruction generation, it implements methods using chat data, corpus or knowledge graphs as seeds. 
- For selection, it offers various statistics-based and LM-based metrics.
- EasyInstruct aims to standardize and facilitate instruction processing research and development.

Main Contributions:
- EasyInstruct enables automated high-quality instruction data generation at scale using LLMs. 
- It reduces the need for expensive manual annotation.
- The modular design makes it easy for both novice and expert users to build customized instruction processing pipelines.  
- EasyInstruct helps promote further research by providing a standardized platform for developing and comparing instruction processing techniques.
- It is publicly available and actively maintained to incorporate the evolving needs of the LLM community.

In summary, EasyInstruct facilitates streamlined development of instruction processing capabilities to improve the tuning process for LLMs through automated quality instruction data generation and selection tools in an easy-to-use standardized platform.
