# [Exploring Answer Information Methods for Question Generation with   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03483)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores different methods for incorporating answer information into transformer-based models for question generation using the SQuAD dataset. The methods analyzed include answer prompting (AP), where the answer is concatenated to the input passage; using an additional answer attention (AA) mechanism in the decoder; only using sentences containing the answer (RS); and a custom product (CP) method between the encoder outputs and answer embeddings. The models are evaluated using ROUGE-L, METEOR, and answer accuracy of the generated questions. The results show that simple answer prompting works best, outperforming the other techniques across the evaluation metrics. Adding the related sentences actually hurts performance compared to pure answer prompting. The custom product method improves when combined with related sentences but not with answer prompting. Overall, the simplicity of concatentating the answer strings gives the best question generation quality based on the metrics used. The authors suggest additional future work could explore different base transformer architectures and whether certain answer incorporation methods work better with some architectures compared to others.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper explores the effect of different methods for incorporating answer information such as answer prompting, using a custom product of answer embeddings and encoder outputs, choosing answer-related sentences, and adding an answer attention mechanism on the quality of automatically generated questions from passages using transformer models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be an analysis of different methods for incorporating answer information into transformer-based models for question generation. Specifically, the paper:

- Explores multiple strategies for providing answer information to the model during question generation, including answer prompting (AP), using an additional answer attention mechanism (AA), only using sentences related to the answer (RS), and a custom product method between encoder outputs and answer embeddings (CP). 

- Evaluates these different answer incorporation methods, both alone and in combinations, using automatic evaluation metrics like ROUGE-L, METEOR, and answer accuracy to see their effect on the quality of generated questions.

- Finds that simply prompting the model with the answer (AP) works best across all metrics compared to the other more complex strategies. Combining methods tends to hurt performance compared to AP alone.

So in summary, the main contribution is an analysis via experiments to determine effective ways to provide answer information to transformer models to improve question generation performance. The key finding is that a simple answer prompting method works best for this task.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper explores different methods to incorporate answer information into the question generation model. What were the four key methods explored? Explain each method briefly.

2. The paper uses BART as the base model architecture. Why was BART chosen over other transformer models like BERT, GPT-2 etc.? What are the key components of the BART architecture?

3. The paper evaluates the proposed methods using ROUGE-L, METEOR and answer accuracy percentage. Why were these specific metrics chosen? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using these metrics? 

4. The 'Answer Prompting' (AP) method gives the best performance overall. Why do you think concatenating the answer to the passage works better than the other proposed methods?

5. The custom product (CP) method uses a constant 'k' when multiplying the encoder outputs with the answer distribution. How is this constant value determined? What impact does this constant have on model performance?

6. The paper finds that adding Related Sentences (RS) to Answer Prompting (AP) decreases performance. Why would selecting only answer-related sentences not help the model? Were any other sentence selection strategies explored?

7. The paper uses a Question Answering (QA) model to evaluate how many generated questions can be answered correctly. What type of QA model was used? Would using a different architecture impact results?

8. Were there any human evaluations conducted to assess relevance or fluency of questions? Would this give additional insights beyond the automatic metrics?

9. How were hyperparameter values like batch size, learning rate etc. decided upon? Was there any tuning performed? Would tuning improve results?

10. The paper focuses only on the SQuAD dataset. How would the proposed methods translate to other question generation datasets? Would any architecture modifications help generalizability?
