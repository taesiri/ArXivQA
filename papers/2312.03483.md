# [Exploring Answer Information Methods for Question Generation with   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03483)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores different methods for incorporating answer information into transformer-based models for question generation using the SQuAD dataset. The methods analyzed include answer prompting (AP), where the answer is concatenated to the input passage; using an additional answer attention (AA) mechanism in the decoder; only using sentences containing the answer (RS); and a custom product (CP) method between the encoder outputs and answer embeddings. The models are evaluated using ROUGE-L, METEOR, and answer accuracy of the generated questions. The results show that simple answer prompting works best, outperforming the other techniques across the evaluation metrics. Adding the related sentences actually hurts performance compared to pure answer prompting. The custom product method improves when combined with related sentences but not with answer prompting. Overall, the simplicity of concatentating the answer strings gives the best question generation quality based on the metrics used. The authors suggest additional future work could explore different base transformer architectures and whether certain answer incorporation methods work better with some architectures compared to others.
