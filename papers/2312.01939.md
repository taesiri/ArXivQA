# [Foundations for Transfer in Reinforcement Learning: A Taxonomy of   Knowledge Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01939)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive taxonomy of transfer learning in reinforcement learning (RL) through the lens of knowledge modalities - the different forms in which knowledge can be represented and transferred, including raw data, dynamics models, reward models, value functions, and policies. It discusses preparation methods for extracting knowledge from source environments or datasets, as well as application methods for leveraging that knowledge in target environments, covering both direct usage and indirect integration into the learning process. Key tradeoffs are analyzed, like computational efficiency versus flexibility and bias. Trends are highlighted like scaling up source domains and pre-training models to improve generalization, using meta-learning to optimize for efficient fine-tuning, and combining modular knowledge sources. Challenges are examined like limited benchmarks and scarce large-scale RL datasets compared to other fields. Overall the paper delivers a systematic framework for understanding the breadth of transfer learning techniques, their interconnections, and open problems, providing fertile ground for future advancements in scalable, general RL agents.
