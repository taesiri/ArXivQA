# [Aligning brain functions boosts the decoding of visual semantics in   novel subjects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06467)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a method to boost brain decoding performance by aligning brain responses across subjects watching the same videos. They first confirm the feasibility of decoding high-level visual features like objects and scenes from fMRI signals during free viewing of videos. However, there is large variability in representations across individuals, making it difficult to train a single decoder. They address this by using optimal transport to functionally align one "left-out" subject's brain responses to match a reference subject with more training data. This alignment transforms the left-out subject's features to resemble the reference. They show this allows pre-trained decoders or models trained on multiple subjects to effectively generalize to new individuals, improving performance by 25-75% over anatomical alignment alone. Crucially, this works even when new subjects have very limited data (~30 min), enabling their brain features to benefit from models trained on much more data in other subjects. The computed alignments also prove anatomically meaningful, matching up sensory cortical areas. Thus this work provides an important advance for enabling semantic decoders trained on extensive individual data to successfully decode brain signals from new subjects.
