# [FlashAvatar: High-Fidelity Digital Avatar Rendering at 300FPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02214)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for high-fidelity animatable avatars struggle to achieve real-time rendering speeds, even on high-end hardware. This limits their use in interactive applications like AR/VR.
- Methods based on 3D morphable models lack details due to reliance on coarse geometry. Implicit neural representations can capture details but are slow.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose FlashAvatar, a novel avatar representation that combines non-neural 3D Gaussians with an explicit parametric face model. 
- Initialize a Gaussian field on the surface of a parametric face mesh. Gaussians move along with mesh vertices to capture expression changes.
- Learn additional spatial offsets for Gaussians using an MLP conditioned on expression codes. This models details beyond mesh surface like hair, accessories and wrinkles.
- Achieve highly detailed avatars while using a compact fixed number of Gaussians attached to face surface. This enables real-time rendering.

Main Contributions:
- First work to combine parametric face model with Gaussian splatting for avatar modeling. Utilizes complementary strengths.
- Flexible UV space sampling for optimal Gaussian initialization on mesh surface.  
- Detailed avatar reconstruction from short monocular video in minutes.  
- Photo-realistic rendering quality with full personalized details.
- Remarkably fast and stable rendering speed of 300 FPS on consumer GPUs.

In summary, the paper proposes FlashAvatar that can reconstruct high-fidelity animatable avatars from monocular video in minutes and achieve real-time rendering speeds through a novel combination of parametric face models and non-neural 3D Gaussians.
