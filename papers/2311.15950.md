# [Auto-CsiNet: Scenario-customized Automatic Neural Network Architecture   Generation for Massive MIMO CSI Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15950)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Auto-CsiNet, an automated framework to generate optimal neural network architectures for CSI feedback in wireless communications. Manual design of CSI feedback networks is labor-intensive and limited in customizing networks to specific scenarios. Auto-CsiNet employs neural architecture search (NAS) and machine learning automation to automatically generate scenario-customized CSI feedback networks without human effort. It is based on an efficient gradient-descent NAS method called PC-DARTS that controls the search space and cost. Additional refinements like early stopping prevent performance degradation from over-searching. Experiments show Auto-CsiNet outperforms state-of-the-art manually-designed networks in accuracy and complexity across indoor/outdoor datasets. A key benefit is automatic scenario customization to maximize performance, significantly outperforming general networks not customized per scenario. Analysis reveals NAS can integrate implicit scene knowledge to match architecture complexity to environment, alleviating issues like network degradation. Overall, Auto-CsiNet enables automated, efficient and customizable CSI feedback network design to unlock the full potential of deep learning in wireless communications.
