# [Learn to Optimize Denoising Scores for 3D Generation: A Unified and   Improved Diffusion Prior on NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04820)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a unified framework called LODS (Learn to Optimize Denoising Scores) to enhance diffusion priors for high-fidelity 3D generation tasks. The key insight is that there is a divergence between the training and inference stages of diffusion models due to the use of classifier free guidance (CFG) only during inference. This causes the commonly used SDS loss to direct the 3D model optimization towards a CFG-modified distribution rather than the actual learned distribution, resulting in suboptimal quality. To address this, LODS introduces additional learnable parameters and iteratively optimizes both the 3D model and the diffusion prior to align them better. Two variants are presented - using a learnable unconditional embedding or low-rank model parameters. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art text-to-3D generation quality using NeRF and 3D Gaussian splatting backbones. The simple embedding-based LODS approach significantly improves results with minimal code changes. Besides advancing text-to-3D generation, LODS also shows strong qualitative performance on image-to-3D generation and 2D image editing tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a unified framework called LODS that enhances 3D generation quality by iteratively optimizing both the 3D model and the diffusion prior to align the model more closely with the distribution learned by the original diffusion model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a unified framework called LODS (Learn to Optimize Denoising Scores) to enhance the diffusion prior by iteratively optimizing both the 3D model and the denoising scores. This aligns the 3D model more closely with the distribution learned by the original diffusion model.

2) Examining two types of learnable parameters in the framework - the learnable unconditional embedding and low-rank model parameters. These provide flexibility for various trade-offs between performance and implementation complexity. 

3) Achieving new state-of-the-art performance on text-to-3D generation benchmarks, significantly outperforming previous methods. The approach also demonstrates strong performance on image-guided 3D generation.

4) Providing insights into limitations of previous diffusion priors like SDS and VSD losses, and explaining why the proposed methods are able to enhance the quality.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the LODS framework to improve diffusion priors for 3D generation via optimizing denoising scores, and showing its state-of-the-art performance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two main variants of the LODS framework: embedding-based optimization and parameter-based optimization. Can you elaborate on the key differences between these two approaches and discuss situational trade-offs between using one versus the other? 

2. The paper argues there is a divergence between the training and inference phases of diffusion models that leads to suboptimal performance when using the standard SDS loss. Can you explain this argument in more detail and why resolving this divergence is critical?  

3. Algorithm 1 outlines the high-level LODS approach. Can you walk through this algorithm step-by-step and analyze the purpose and expected outcome of each step? 

4. Equation 4 defines the normalized SDS loss used initially. Why is this used instead of the standard SDS loss, and how does normalizing in this manner ease the subsequent learning process?

5. For the embedding-based optimization, Equation 7 defines the loss used to optimize the learnable unconditional embedding. Explain the intuition behind optimizing the embedding in this manner to align with the reference SDS loss. 

6. The parameter-based optimization variant utilizes a LoRA model. What is the motivation for optimizing additional low-rank parameters in this framework? What are the potential benefits and downsides?

7. The paper discusses relations between LODS and other recent methods like VSD and DDS losses. Can you compare and contrast LODS to these methods in terms of the problem formulation and optimization approach? 

8. One limitation raised is that LODS currently focuses more on improving texture quality over geometry. Can you propose ideas for how LODS could be extended to better capture geometry as well?

9. The results demonstrate strong quantitative gains over prior arts, but what about qualitative advantages? Can you analyze sample visual results to highlight qualitative improvements stemming from LODS?

10. The paper focuses on 3D generation tasks but shows 2D results too. Based on the 2D outcomes, can you discuss how LODS could be adapted to specifically target 2D image editing as the end goal?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing diffusion priors like the SDS loss often produce low-quality 3D generation results that lack detail and diversity. This is due to a divergence between the training and inference procedures of diffusion models. Specifically, classifier free guidance (CFG) is used during inference but not during training, creating a discrepancy.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a unified framework called LODS (Learn to Optimize Denoising Scores) to enhance diffusion priors for 3D generation. 
- It introduces two additional learnable parameters - a learnable unconditional embedding and low-rank model parameters. These parameters are optimized to iteratively align the diffusion prior with the score function learned during training.
- This bridges the gap between training and inference and produces diffusion priors that generate higher quality and more diverse 3D results.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies issues with existing diffusion priors like SDS loss leading to low-quality 3D generation.
- Proposes the LODS framework to enhance diffusion priors by optimizing additional learnable parameters.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art in text-to-3D generation outperforming methods like VSD loss.
- Demonstrates consistent performance gains across tasks like text-to-3D, image-to-3D using NeRF and 3D Gaussian splatting backbones.
- Provides qualitative evidence that the framework can also enable high-quality 2D image generation and editing.

In summary, the paper introduces a simple yet effective framework to improve diffusion priors for 3D generation by aligning the training and inference distributions. This allows producing more detailed and diverse 3D results across various tasks and backbones.
