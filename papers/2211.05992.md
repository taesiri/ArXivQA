# [Delay Embedded Echo-State Network: A Predictor for Partially Observed   Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05992)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper considers the problem of predicting future values of a time series that is generated as a partial/incomplete observation from a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. While recurrent neural networks like echo state networks (ESNs) can effectively model and predict nonlinear systems given full state measurements, training them with only partial observations poses significant challenges. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a method to train an ESN to predict future values of a partially observed time series using time delay embeddings of the measurements. The key ideas are:

1) Taken's embedding theorem states that the attractor of a nonlinear dynamical system can be diffeomorphically reconstructed by a time delay embedding of a generic scalar measurement from the system. 

2) For a strongly observable nonlinear system, there exists a mapping from the delay embedded measurements to the next step measurement value. 

3) An ESN with echo state property can approximate any fading memory nonlinear map.

Combining these facts, the paper shows that an ESN can be trained with delay embedded partial measurements to effectively predict the next step value.

The proposed delay embedded ESN algorithm is provided and its working is demonstrated on synthetic data from the chaotic Lorenz and Rossler systems where only one state is observed. It is also applied to real traffic volume time series data from road network sensors.

Main Contributions:

- A data-driven prediction method for partially observed dynamical systems using delay embedded ESN

- Theoretical justification based on Takens' theorem and notions of observability in nonlinear systems

- Demonstrated improvement in prediction performance on chaotic systems over ESN without delay embedding

- First time application of delay embedded ESN on real traffic data showing significant performance gain with increasing embedding dimension

In summary, the paper develops a way to train neural network based predictors using partial and incomplete measurements only by utilizing time delay embeddings. This can enable data-driven forecasting for several complex systems where only limited observations are available.
