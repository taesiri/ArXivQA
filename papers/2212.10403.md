## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Develop better benchmarks and tasks for evaluating reasoning abilities in LLMs. The authors note that current benchmarks may be too simple and artificial to properly assess the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. More realistic, complex, and meaningful tasks are needed.

- Conduct more in-depth analysis on the reasoning process and steps of LLMs. Most current work focuses on end task accuracy rather than directly examining the quality of rationales produced by LLMs. Further research is needed to analyze whether LLMs are truly reasoning versus relying on patterns and heuristics. 

- Improve training techniques to enhance reasoning abilities in LLMs. The authors suggest using training data, architectures, and objectives designed specifically to encourage reasoning, such as through bootstrapping and self-improvement.

- Explore the impact of factors like model scale, training data, and optimization objectives on reasoning in LLMs through ablation studies and analysis. A better understanding of these factors could shed light on how to improve reasoning.

- Test reasoning abilities of LLMs on more realistic applications like decision making, legal reasoning, and scientific reasoning, rather than just performance on simple math or logic problems.

- Develop multimodal benchmarks to assess reasoning across modalities like vision and language.

- Examine forms of reasoning beyond deductive reasoning, such as inductive and abductive reasoning.

In summary, the authors call for more challenging evaluations, formal analysis, improved training methods, studies on key factors, tests on real-world applications, multimodal reasoning, and exploring diverse reasoning types in future work.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current research on reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs). The first paragraph of the paper summarizes the key concepts and techniques that have been explored for improving and evaluating reasoning in LLMs. It notes that reasoning is considered an emergent ability in large models, and methods like chain-of-thought prompting have been shown to elicit reasoning from LLMs. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs are truly capable of reasoning versus relying on heuristics. The paper discusses techniques for training models to improve reasoning, prompting methods to elicit reasoning, evaluation benchmarks, and key findings from studies analyzing reasoning in LLMs. 

The second paragraph reflects on limitations of current research and open questions remaining in this field. The authors note that existing reasoning benchmarks may be too simplistic and artificial to properly evaluate LLMs' capabilities. They emphasize the need for more realistic, complex benchmarks and consideration of meaningful real-world applications of reasoning. Additional limitations include the lack of formal analysis of the quality of rationales produced by LLMs. The authors conclude that further research is still needed to fully understand the reasoning abilities of LLMs, determine if they are actually reasoning versus generating responses, improve their reasoning capabilities, and evaluate their potential for reasoning-intensive applications. More in-depth analysis of factors like model architecture and training is called for.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method used in the paper is a technique called "chain of thought" prompting. The authors propose providing a few examples of "chain of thought" (CoT) in the prompt to large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3. In CoT prompting, the standard input-output exemplar pairs are replaced with input-chain of thought-output triples. For example, instead of just showing "input: Roger has 5 balls, buys 2 more cans of 3 balls each. output: 11 balls", the prompt would show "input: Roger has 5 balls... chain of thought: Roger had 5 balls originally, 2 cans have 3 balls each which is 6 more balls, 5 + 6 is 11... output: 11 balls". In this way, the LLM learns to explicitly generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing the final answer for a given question. The authors demonstrate that this simple idea of prompting for explicit reasoning chains significantly improves the performance of LLMs like GPT-3 on various reasoning tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth discussion questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper discusses using chain-of-thought prompting to elicit reasoning from large language models. However, it remains unclear whether the models are actually engaging in true reasoning or simply generating responses that appear reasoned. How could we design experiments or analyses to better evaluate whether genuine reasoning is occurring with this prompting technique?

Do these variants confer any advantages over the original chain-of-thought prompting technique? In what types of reasoning tasks might each variant be most effective? 

3. Rationale engineering techniques like rationale refinement and rationale verification are introduced to create better reasoning prompts and validate the rationales. But how can we ensure the rationales generated by these techniques accurately reflect human reasoning processes and are not just optimized for model performance?

4. For problem decomposition techniques, how do we determine the best way to break down a complex problem into subproblems? Could the wrong decomposition actually hinder reasoning if it divides the problem in an unnatural or illogical way?

5. The paper discusses training techniques like reasoning-enhanced pretraining and self-supervised bootstrapping to improve reasoning abilities. Do these techniques confer lasting improvements to reasoning that transfer across tasks, or do gains diminish over time?

6. How can we design training objectives and datasets to maximize improvement of reasoning skills rather than just performance on specialized benchmarks? What types of data would be most valuable for reasoning enhancement?

7. For the analysis methods discussed, what are their limitations in fully evaluating whether true reasoning is occurring? How could these analysis techniques be expanded to provide deeper insight into the reasoning process?

8. Since many of the methods rely heavily on prompts and demonstrations, how brittle are these techniques to changes in phrasing and content? How could they be made more robust?

9. The paper focuses on informal deductive reasoning, but how could the methods be adapted to elicit and evaluate other forms of reasoning like inductive, abductive, analogical, etc.?

10. If language models are shown to be incapable of true reasoning using these methods, does this represent an architectural limitation, or could advances in model design enable reasoning capabilities to emerge? What architectural changes might encourage reasoning?
