## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this survey paper compares to other work on reasoning in large language models:- Scope: This paper provides a broad overview of techniques, evaluation methods, findings, and implications related to reasoning in LLMs. Other papers tend to focus on specific methods or findings. For example, the survey by Qiao et al. (2022) emphasizes prompting techniques. - Comprehensiveness: This survey discusses a wide range of relevant literature on improving, evaluating, and analyzing reasoning abilities in LLMs. It covers major techniques like chain-of-thought prompting as well as less explored methods like problem decomposition. The coverage seems quite comprehensive.- Clarity: The paper is well-structured and clearly written. The background and motivation are clearly explained in the introduction. The methods, evaluations, findings, and discussion sections provide useful taxonomies and summaries. The limitations of the survey are also explicitly stated.- Objectivity: The paper appears to provide an objective overview of the state of research on reasoning in LLMs. The authors surface debates in the field and critically analyze claims about reasoning abilities. The discussion section thoughtfully reflects on open questions.- Timeliness: This survey covers recent studies on large models like PaLM and Flan-T5, demonstrating awareness of the latest developments. However, research is rapidly evolving in this area, so newer papers may exist.- Originality: While drawing on other surveys like Qiao et al. (2022), this paper takes its own structure and perspective. The focus is on reviewing techniques for improving reasoning and methods for evaluation. The reflection and discussion sections provide novel insights.Overall, this survey provides a comprehensive, timely, and original overview of a fast-moving research area. It will likely serve as a useful reference for researchers and drive further progress on an important open question - whether LLMs can truly reason. The scope is appropriate, and the analysis is thoughtful.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Develop better benchmarks and tasks for evaluating reasoning abilities in LLMs. The authors note that current benchmarks may be too simple and artificial to properly assess the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. More realistic, complex, and meaningful tasks are needed.- Conduct more in-depth analysis on the reasoning process and steps of LLMs. Most current work focuses on end task accuracy rather than directly examining the quality of rationales produced by LLMs. Further research is needed to analyze whether LLMs are truly reasoning versus relying on patterns and heuristics. - Improve training techniques to enhance reasoning abilities in LLMs. The authors suggest using training data, architectures, and objectives designed specifically to encourage reasoning, such as through bootstrapping and self-improvement.- Explore the impact of factors like model scale, training data, and optimization objectives on reasoning in LLMs through ablation studies and analysis. A better understanding of these factors could shed light on how to improve reasoning.- Test reasoning abilities of LLMs on more realistic applications like decision making, legal reasoning, and scientific reasoning, rather than just performance on simple math or logic problems.- Develop multimodal benchmarks to assess reasoning across modalities like vision and language.- Examine forms of reasoning beyond deductive reasoning, such as inductive and abductive reasoning.In summary, the authors call for more challenging evaluations, formal analysis, improved training methods, studies on key factors, tests on real-world applications, multimodal reasoning, and exploring diverse reasoning types in future work.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current research on reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs). The first paragraph of the paper summarizes the key concepts and techniques that have been explored for improving and evaluating reasoning in LLMs. It notes that reasoning is considered an emergent ability in large models, and methods like chain-of-thought prompting have been shown to elicit reasoning from LLMs. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs are truly capable of reasoning versus relying on heuristics. The paper discusses techniques for training models to improve reasoning, prompting methods to elicit reasoning, evaluation benchmarks, and key findings from studies analyzing reasoning in LLMs. The second paragraph reflects on limitations of current research and open questions remaining in this field. The authors note that existing reasoning benchmarks may be too simplistic and artificial to properly evaluate LLMs' capabilities. They emphasize the need for more realistic, complex benchmarks and consideration of meaningful real-world applications of reasoning. Additional limitations include the lack of formal analysis of the quality of rationales produced by LLMs. The authors conclude that further research is still needed to fully understand the reasoning abilities of LLMs, determine if they are actually reasoning versus generating responses, improve their reasoning capabilities, and evaluate their potential for reasoning-intensive applications. More in-depth analysis of factors like model architecture and training is called for.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The main method used in the paper is a technique called "chain of thought" prompting. The authors propose providing a few examples of "chain of thought" (CoT) in the prompt to large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3. In CoT prompting, the standard input-output exemplar pairs are replaced with input-chain of thought-output triples. For example, instead of just showing "input: Roger has 5 balls, buys 2 more cans of 3 balls each. output: 11 balls", the prompt would show "input: Roger has 5 balls... chain of thought: Roger had 5 balls originally, 2 cans have 3 balls each which is 6 more balls, 5 + 6 is 11... output: 11 balls". In this way, the LLM learns to explicitly generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing the final answer for a given question. The authors demonstrate that this simple idea of prompting for explicit reasoning chains significantly improves the performance of LLMs like GPT-3 on various reasoning tasks.
