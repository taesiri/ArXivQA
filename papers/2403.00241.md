# [CASIMIR: A Corpus of Scientific Articles enhanced with Multiple   Author-Integrated Revisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00241)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Scientific writing is challenging as it requires adhering to specific conventions and effectively conveying complex ideas. Tools to provide automated assistance for improving scientific writing quality are needed. 

- Existing datasets to train such AI writing assistance tools have limitations like small size, incomplete papers, only 2 versions per paper, or lack of peer reviews.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce CASIMIR, a new large-scale corpus for scientific text revision containing multiple revised versions for 15,646 full-length English research papers from OpenReview.

- It has 3.7 million pairs of aligned edited sentences with 5.2 million individual edits, each labeled with a revision intention category (content, grammar, format, language). 

- Metadata like paragraph location, peer reviews and paper venue is also included.

Main Contributions:

1. Released a large open corpus for research on scientific text revision.

2. Conducted analysis on distribution of versions, edits, evolution of revisions over iterations and location inside articles.

3. Evaluated several state-of-the-art text revision models on the data and compared multiple evaluation metrics.

4. Results indicated issues with current evaluation methods for text revision task, warranting new approaches that capture semantic meaning.

The corpus enables developing scientific writing assistance tools that leverage contextual discourse-level information and associated reviews. Limitations include noise due to automatic processing and ethical considerations regarding personal data in reviews.
