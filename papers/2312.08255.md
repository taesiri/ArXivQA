# [OCTDL: Optical Coherence Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep   Learning Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08255)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents OCTDL, a new open-access optical coherence tomography (OCT) image dataset comprising over 1600 high-resolution scans labeled across various retinal diseases and conditions. The images were obtained using an Optovue Avanti system and manually categorized by an experienced retinal specialist. The dataset includes common pathologies such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, epiretinal membrane, and vitreomacular interface disease. Example OCT scans showcase distinctive morphological patterns for each condition. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, the authors trained deep convolutional neural networks (VGG16 and ResNet50) on OCTDL and additional public datasets (OCTID and Kermany). Classification performance was strong, with accuracies approaching 90-98\% across individual and combined datasets. The large, diverse OCTDL collection can support research in automated diagnosis, segmentation, and anomaly detection for ocular diseases. Overall, this paper offers a valuable resource to advance artificial intelligence in retinal imaging and care.
