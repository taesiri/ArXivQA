## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Manually creating high-quality textures for 3D meshes is very time-consuming and requires expertise in visual design. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have enabled automatically generating images from text prompts. However, existing techniques for leveraging such models to generate textures for 3D meshes have three key limitations: (1) very slow texture generation, taking tens of minutes per texture, (2) visual artifacts like blurriness, seams, and lack of details, and (3) lighting baked into textures making them not relightable. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes an efficient text-to-texture pipeline that generates high-quality, relightable textures for a 3D mesh based on a text prompt. The key ideas are:

1) Introduce LightControlNet - an illumination-aware diffusion model that allows specifying desired lighting as a conditioning image. This is used to generate reference views of the mesh.

2) A two-stage texture generation process: 
   Stage 1 uses multi-view visual prompting with LightControlNet to create consistent reference views under fixed lighting. 
   Stage 2 performs texture optimization using the reference views to guide a hash-grid texture representation. An SDS loss works with LightControlNet to increase quality and disentangle lighting.

Main Contributions:

- LightControlNet model to control lighting in text-to-image generation 
- Efficient two-stage texturing pipeline leveraging LightControlNet
- Texture optimization procedure using reference views from LightControlNet as guidance
- Demonstrated high-quality textures 10x faster than prior work  
- Lighting successfully disentangled from surface properties/reflectance
- Superior results compared to previous texturing baselines

The key advantage is the ability to generate relightable, high-quality textures with an order of magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art. This facilitates the wide-spread adoption of automatically generating textures from text prompts.
