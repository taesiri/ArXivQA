# [The Curious Case of Nonverbal Abstract Reasoning with Multi-Modal Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12117)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper investigates whether multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate faithful nonverbal abstract reasoning abilities. Nonverbal abstract reasoning tasks require strong visual perception and explicit reasoning abilities. While large language models (LLMs) and large vision models (LVMs) have shown promising abilities on some reasoning tasks, MLLMs have the potential to perform even better by fusing verbal and visual cues. However, there has been limited analysis of MLLMs' reasoning abilities.

Proposed Solution 
The paper evaluates 24 open-source and closed-source MLLMs on 3 datasets based on Raven's Progressive Matrices, which require identifying a missing visual puzzle piece from options. Both automatic metrics and manual inspection are used. Additionally, textual reasoning and visual perception modules are evaluated separately to identify limitations. Experiments also test whether guided prompting and in-context learning can improve performance.

Key Findings
- Open-source MLLMs perform very poorly on reasoning tasks, while closed-source models like GPT-4V show some promising skills. However, no model surpasses simple heuristic baselines.
- Both visual and textual modules have critical flaws. Models fail at extracting precise visual details and at reasoning correctly/faithfully from textual puzzle descriptions.   
- Closed-source models benefit greatly from guided prompting and in-context demonstrations with step-by-step reasoning, boosting performance up to 100%. Open-source models do not improve under similar conditions.

Main Contributions 
- Comprehensive benchmarking of reasoning skills across many MLLMs using Raven's style puzzles
- In-depth analysis of visual and textual limitations causing poor performance 
- Experiments showing closed-source models can substantially improve with guided prompting and demonstrations, while open-source models cannot

The paper reveals critical gaps in MLLMs' fluid intelligence abilities and provides direction for future research to focus on grounded evaluations targeting core reasoning skills.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper evaluates the nonverbal abstract reasoning abilities of various multi-modal large language models using Raven's Progressive Matrices benchmarks and finds that while closed-source models show some promising capabilities, overall the models still lag behind simple heuristics and have critical shortcomings in both visual and textual reasoning that limit their performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Evaluating the nonverbal abstract reasoning abilities of 24 open-source and closed-source multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) under three Raven's Progressive Matrices benchmarks.

2. Evaluating MLLMs' textual and perceptual capabilities in isolated settings to minimize cross-modality error propagation, providing insights into their performance ceiling. 

3. Evaluating MLLMs' autonomous (i.e. zero-shot) and in-context learning (i.e. few-shot) abilities, drawing a more accurate picture of the alignment between their verbal and visual perceptions.

In summary, the paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the reasoning abilities of modern MLLMs using nonverbal abstract reasoning tasks, identifies key deficiencies, and experiments with methods to improve performance. The goal is to better understand if MLLMs demonstrate faithful reasoning abilities through this multi-modal evaluation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
- Nonverbal abstract reasoning
- Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM)
- Fluid intelligence
- Visual perception
- Textual reasoning
- Error analysis 
- Guided prompting
- In-context learning (ICL)
- Symmetrical few-shot learning
- Asymmetrical few-shot learning

The paper evaluates the nonverbal abstract reasoning abilities of various open-source and closed-source MLLMs using RPM-style tasks. It analyzes the models' visual and textual capabilities, identifies shortcomings, and experiments with methods like guided prompting and in-context learning to try to improve performance. The key focus areas are assessing reasoning skills, analyzing errors, and attempting to boost abilities through prompting strategies.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper evaluates MLLMs on 3 specific RPM-style datasets. Do you think the conclusions would still hold if more diverse abstract reasoning datasets were used, especially ones not in an RPM format? Why or why not? 

2) The paper finds both visual and textual deficiencies in open-source MLLMs. Do you think one modality is more problematic than the other? And for closed-source models?

3) Chain-of-Thought prompting is found to significantly boost model performance. Could this prompting strategy be productized to make MLLMs more capable for real applications? What challenges might exist?

4) The paper hypothesizes text-only prompts should improve performance by clarifying input/output spaces. Yet results show model degradation instead. What could explain this surprising outcome? 

5) Corrective prompting works well, but requires human involvement. Could this process ever be automated? How might a model correct its own "thinking"?

6) The paper evaluates autonomous and in-context reasoning. Do you think models will reach human-level reasoning more through autonomous capability gains or via in-context learning?

7) Results find open-source MLLMs exhibit poor in-context learning. Might scaling laws eventually kick in at some model size? Or are architectural constraints holding models back?

8) The paper links language and vision for reasoning. Could non-verbal sound/audio also strengthen reasoning if incorporated into models? What unique benefits might audio provide?

9) The paper finds reasoning performance quite low overall. Do you think datasets today properly evaluate an MLLM's intelligence? If not, what new datasets might better challenge future models?

10) The paper covers supervised RPM datasets. How well do you think MLLMs could perform if challenged with more complex, unstructured visual reasoning problems that require real-world common sense?
