# [Measuring and Controlling Persona Drift in Language Model Dialogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10962)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Personalized prompts are commonly used to customize chatbot behavior and give them a specific "persona". An implicit assumption is that prompts lead to stable behavior over long conversations. 
- However, there is anecdotal evidence that chatbot "personas" tend to drift or degrade during conversations, with responses straying from the stipulated behavior. This lack of persona stability poses issues for prompt engineering.

Contributions:
1) Quantitative benchmark to measure persona drift, using self-chats between two personalized chatbots. Experiments on LLaMA reveal significant drift over just 8 rounds.

2) Empirical and theoretical analysis linking drift to attention decay - the model pays less attention to prompt tokens over longer dialogs. This expands the space of possible outputs.

3) Lightweight method called "split-softmax" to mitigate attention decay and persona drift at inference time. Shows better stability-performance tradeoff than strong baselines.

Proposed Solution - Split Softmax:
- Splits the softmax over two groups of tokens - those from the prompt and the conversation history. 
- Power-law intervention that shifts more attention to prompt tokens.
- No model retraining or architectural changes needed.

Results:
- Benchmark shows persona drift in LLaMA2 over 8 rounds of self-chat.
- Empirically measure sharp attention decay to prompts across chat turns.  
- Split-softmax achieves equal or better stability vs baselines for a given performance drop.
- Provides better stability-performance tradeoff and generalization over conversation length.

Overall, the paper identifies and quantifies the issue of persona drift in chatbots, links it to attention decay, and proposes a lightweight mitigation method. The stability benchmark and analysis offer insights into improving chatbot reliability.
