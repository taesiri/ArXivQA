# [How Interpretable are Reasoning Explanations from Prompting Large   Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11863)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Interpretability of explanations from large language models (LLMs) prompted with techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is important but not well studied. Specifically, the faithfulness, robustness and utility of such reasoning explanations need comprehensive evaluation. 

- Prior works assess faithfulness of CoT explanations but don't consider other prompting techniques or other dimensions of interpretability like robustness and utility.

Methodology:
- Proposed a new prompt called Self-Entailment-Alignment CoT (SEA-CoT) to improve interpretability of explanations by selecting reasoning chains based on maximizing entailment and overlap with context.

- Evaluated CoT, SEA-CoT and other prompting techniques (self-consistent CoT, question decomposition, self-refine) on 3 axes:
   1) Faithfulness: Using paraphrasing, mistake insertion and counterfactuals
   2) Robustness: Via paraphrasing 
   3) Utility: Using forward simulatability

- Experiments were done on OBQA, QASC and StrategyQA datasets using 70B Llama-v2 model.

Key Contributions:

- First comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation of interpretability of reasoning explanations from LLMs across different prompting techniques

- Proposed SEA-CoT method substantially improves interpretability over other methods on faithfulness, robustness and utility

- Utility improvements indicate SEA-CoT produces explanations that are more useful for teaching student models

- Showed interpretability drops at lower model sizes but SEA-CoT still outperforms other prompts 

In summary, this paper presented an extensive analysis of interpretability of LLM explanations using new techniques and metrics, and introduced a novel prompt that yields significantly more interpretable reasoning chains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes and evaluates a self-entailment-alignment chain-of-thought (SEA-CoT) method to enhance interpretability of reasoning explanations generated by large language models, demonstrating significant improvements over other prompting techniques across multiple dimensions of interpretability including faithfulness, robustness, and utility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper presents a comprehensive and multifaceted evaluation of the interpretability of reasoning explanations generated by large language models using different prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The evaluation examines the faithfulness, robustness, and utility of the reasoning explanations across multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks.

2) The paper proposes a simple interpretability alignment technique called Self-Entailment-Alignment Chain-of-Thought (SEA-CoT) that yields over 70% improvements in interpretability across multiple metrics compared to other prompting techniques. SEA-CoT chooses the most interpretable reasoning explanation by maximizing the entailment and overlap between the explanation and the supported context (question + answer).

3) The paper conducts an extensive investigation into the reasoning explanations generated by various prompting techniques used with large language models, beyond just focusing on a single technique. It also examines the influence of model size on the interpretability of explanations.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive evaluation and enhancement of the interpretability of reasoning chains as explanations from large language models using the proposed SEA-CoT technique.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the Self-Entailment-Alignment Chain-of-Thought (SEA-CoT) method specifically align the generated reasoning chain with the context and predicted answer? What objectives does it maximize?

2. Why does the paper argue that choosing explanations based on maximum cumulative probability (as in SC-CoT) is not optimal for improving interpretability? What issues can arise from this approach? 

3. What are the key differences between the entailment and overlap scoring used in SEA-CoT? How do these complement each other in selecting more interpretable reasoning chains?

4. Could you further explain the connection hypothesized between higher utility scores and easier training for student models? Why would context-aligned explanations facilitate more efficient knowledge transfer?

5. How does the paper analyze the trade-offs between task performance and interpretability metrics like mistakes insertion across different prompting techniques? What trends can be observed?

6. What are some limitations of using self-refinement for generating reasoning explanations as opposed to the proposed SEA-CoT method? How do the results support this?

7. Why does the paper argue that factuality alone is not sufficient for determining faithfulness of an explanation? What other traits need to be considered?  

8. How well does the SEA-CoT method scale across models of different sizes? What differences can be observed in the interpretability metrics?

9. What are some ways the choice of N sequences in SC-CoT and SEA-CoT affects the optimization of different interpretability traits? How does this relate to the overall performance?

10. How could the SEA-CoT method be improved or expanded further? What other techniques for enhancing interpretability could it potentially be combined with?
