# [Partial Rankings of Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16565)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of benchmarking and comparing optimization algorithms according to multiple criteria over various test functions. There is currently no agreed upon method for such comparisons that fully utilizes the ordinal information and allows for incomparability when one algorithm performs better on some criteria but worse on others. Existing methods typically aggregate the criteria into a single score, which has major shortcomings. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel framework for comparing optimizers over multiple criteria and test functions. The key idea is to use partial orders to represent cases where some optimizers are incomparable on a given test function. This results in a set of posets (partially ordered sets), one for each test function. To analyze these posets, the paper leverages a recently introduced "union-free generic depth" function which provides a notion of centrality/outlyingness for poset-valued data. By looking at depth values over the posets from all test functions, the method can identify central vs outlier rankings and assess benchmark suite quality.

Main Contributions:
- A framework for multi-criteria benchmarking of optimizers that fully retains ordinal information and allows for incomparability
- Introduction of union-free generic depth for poset-valued data to optimization benchmarking
- Ability to identify test functions leading to typical/atypical rankings of optimizers
- Assessment of diversity/quality of benchmark suites based on distribution of rankings
- Avoidance of shortcomings from aggregation methods by describing distribution of rankings

The method is demonstrated on benchmark results from BBOB and DeepOBS suites. Future work includes statistical inference and an in-depth analysis of benchmark suite design.
