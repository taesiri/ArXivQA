# [Partial Rankings of Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16565)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of benchmarking and comparing optimization algorithms according to multiple criteria over various test functions. There is currently no agreed upon method for such comparisons that fully utilizes the ordinal information and allows for incomparability when one algorithm performs better on some criteria but worse on others. Existing methods typically aggregate the criteria into a single score, which has major shortcomings. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel framework for comparing optimizers over multiple criteria and test functions. The key idea is to use partial orders to represent cases where some optimizers are incomparable on a given test function. This results in a set of posets (partially ordered sets), one for each test function. To analyze these posets, the paper leverages a recently introduced "union-free generic depth" function which provides a notion of centrality/outlyingness for poset-valued data. By looking at depth values over the posets from all test functions, the method can identify central vs outlier rankings and assess benchmark suite quality.

Main Contributions:
- A framework for multi-criteria benchmarking of optimizers that fully retains ordinal information and allows for incomparability
- Introduction of union-free generic depth for poset-valued data to optimization benchmarking
- Ability to identify test functions leading to typical/atypical rankings of optimizers
- Assessment of diversity/quality of benchmark suites based on distribution of rankings
- Avoidance of shortcomings from aggregation methods by describing distribution of rankings

The method is demonstrated on benchmark results from BBOB and DeepOBS suites. Future work includes statistical inference and an in-depth analysis of benchmark suite design.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a framework for benchmarking optimizers that fully exploits ordinal information on multiple criteria by describing the distribution of partial orderings over test functions, avoiding aggregation and allowing for incomparability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel framework for comparing optimizers with respect to multiple criteria over a benchmark suite of test functions. The key ideas are:

1) Represent the performance of optimizers on each test function as a partial order, allowing for incomparability when optimizers perform differently on different criteria. This avoids problematic aggregation. 

2) Use the recently introduced union-free generic depth function to describe the distribution of all these partial orders. This depth function indicates how central or outlying each partial order is relative to the whole benchmark suite. 

3) This framework allows to identify test functions that produce typical vs. atypical rankings of optimizers. It also permits to assess the diversity of problems covered by a benchmark suite.

In summary, the paper introduces a principled approach to benchmark optimizers that fully utilizes ordinal information, allows for incomparability, and describes the distribution instead of a single aggregated ranking. This provides additional insights compared to previous benchmarking methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Partial rankings/orders of optimizers
- Multiple criteria benchmarking 
- Union-free generic depth function
- Centrality and outlyingness of rankings
- Distribution of rankings 
- Avoiding aggregation of rankings
- Incomparability of optimizers
- Benchmark suite design and curation
- Simplicial depth function
- Convex hull operator
- Black-box optimization
- Multi-objective optimization

The paper introduces a framework for benchmarking and comparing optimizers using partial orders and a depth function that describes the distribution of rankings while allowing for incomparabilities. This avoids issues with aggregating multiple criteria rankings into a single total order. The method is illustrated on benchmark suites and results for evaluating deep learning and evolutionary optimizers. There is also discussion of how the framework could inform design and curation of benchmark suites.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper introduces a framework for comparing optimizers according to multiple criteria over various test functions. How does this framework build upon and extend existing approaches for benchmarking optimizers? What are the key differences?

2) The method relies on the concept of "union-free generic depth" for partial orders. Explain this concept in detail and how it allows describing the distribution of all partial rankings while avoiding aggregation. 

3) The definition of the union-free generic depth function involves some intricate mathematical concepts like closure operators. Unpack these concepts and explain intuitively why they are needed to adapt the simplicial depth to partially ordered sets.  

4) The paper states that the framework allows identifying test functions leading to central or outlying rankings of optimizers. Explain what central and outlying refer to in this context. How can this information be used for analyzing benchmark suites?

5) The computational complexity of the method seems to depend heavily on the number of optimizers and test functions. Elaborate how the runtime grows with these factors. Is the method still feasible for large-scale benchmarking tasks?

6) When constructing the partial orders for each test function, the paper handles indifference between optimizers in a specific way. Discuss how indifference was defined and why a naive approach was not suitable.

7) The results section focuses a lot on the BBOB benchmark suite. This suite does not come with predefined optimizers. Discuss the implications of this for interpreting the depth values and the usefulness for benchmark designers.

8) The paper states that the framework permits statistical inference in the future. But it also identifies issues with regarding test functions as i.i.d. observations. Expand on the problems for statistical inference that arise from this.

9) The paper introduces the possibility to restrict analysis to a subset of union-free generic sets for computational reasons. Does this lead to an exact computation of the depth values? Could it impact the results?

10) The approach seems very generally applicable, e.g. also for subset selection, neural architecture search etc. Discuss how the framework could be adopted for such related problems and what modifications would be needed.
