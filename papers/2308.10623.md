# [GaitPT: Skeletons Are All You Need For Gait Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10623)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The main research goal of this paper is to propose a new skeleton-based architecture for gait recognition that improves upon previous state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the authors introduce GaitPT, a hierarchical transformer model that leverages spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to capture both local and global gait patterns from skeleton sequences. The key hypothesis is that modelling the natural hierarchical structure and motion of the human body will lead to better gait recognition performance compared to prior approaches like graph neural networks or flat transformer models. The experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASIA-B, GREW, Gait3D) validate this hypothesis, with GaitPT achieving new state-of-the-art results.In summary, the central research question is: Can a hierarchical transformer architecture designed with anatomical priors improve skeleton-based gait recognition accuracy over previous methods? The authors empirically demonstrate the superiority of their proposed GaitPT model in answering this question.
