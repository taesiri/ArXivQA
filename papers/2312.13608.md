# [Argue with Me Tersely: Towards Sentence-Level Counter-Argument   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13608)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Counter-argument generation seeks to automatically generate opposing viewpoints to input arguments. Prior work has focused on paragraph-level generation, but sentence-level generation poses unique challenges due to space constraints.  
- Evaluating counter-arguments is difficult using only n-gram similarity metrics like BLEU, since counter-arguments can be correct but lexically dissimilar.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce ArgTersely, a new benchmark dataset for sentence-level counter-argument generation, derived from human-annotated Reddit conversations.
- Propose Arg-LlaMA, a framework for high-quality counter-argument generation. It uses a pipeline with:
   1) Instruction components with reasoning templates for common argument errors
   2) An instructed language model (LLaMA-7B) fine-tuned using the instructions
   3) A BERT-based filter model to select the best counter-argument
- Propose two new automatic evaluation metrics:
   1) ChatGPT Eval: Uses ChatGPT to score stance opposition and argument completeness
   2) Arg-Judge: A BERT model trained to score counter-arguments based on human preferences
- Perform comprehensive experiments comparing to baselines like GPT-3, and do ablation studies to validate the approach.

Main Contributions:
- First human-annotated benchmark for sentence-level counter-argument generation
- Novel framework Arg-LlaMA that generates high-quality counter-arguments
- Introduction of model-based automatic evaluation metrics ChatGPT Eval and Arg-Judge, which are shown to correlate well with human judgement

The paper makes solid contributions in creating datasets, models and evaluation methods to advance the task of sentence-level counter-argument generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new benchmark and framework for sentence-level counter-argument generation, including a human-annotated dataset, an instruction-tuned language model, and novel model-based evaluation metrics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a new benchmark called ArgTersely for sentence-level counter-argument generation, along with a human-annotated dataset. 

2) It presents a counter-argument generation framework called Arg-LlaMA which leverages a language model fine-tuned with instruct tuning and a filtering component to generate high-quality counter-arguments. 

3) It proposes two new model-based evaluation metrics called ChatGPT Eval and Arg-Judge to complement n-gram metrics for evaluating counter-argument generation systems. Experiments show these metrics are effective and align well with human evaluations.

In summary, the key contributions are around the new benchmark, the proposed Arg-LlaMA framework, and the new evaluation metrics for sentence-level counter-argument generation. The human-annotated dataset and analysis around the capabilities of language model based evaluators also represent useful additions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instructions during the inference process. What are some potential benefits and limitations of using pre-defined reasoning templates like CoT compared to allowing the model to reason more freely?

2. The CoT instructions are designed to address three common argument errors - factual errors, logical fallacies, and confirmation bias. What are some other types of argument errors that could be addressed by expanding the scope of CoT instructions? 

3. The paper uses instruct-tuning and LoRA to adapt the LLaMA model for the counter-argument generation task. What are the trade-offs between instruct tuning vs regular fine-tuning? Why was LoRA used compared to other adapter methods?

4. The filter model is trained on human preference ranking data between counter-arguments. What are some potential issues with learning from human rankings and how might the model exhibit annotation artifacts or biases?  

5. The Arg-Judge metric aims to capture counter-argument quality using the filter model scores. However, the final metric uses a custom transformation. What is the motivation behind this transformed score instead of using the raw scores?

6. While automatic metrics are proposed, ultimately human evaluation is still very important. What are some key aspects that automatic metrics may fail to capture compared to human assessment? 

7. The case study highlights an example where the proposed method generates a better counter-argument by recognizing implicit assumptions. What modifications could make the model better at "reading between the lines" to surface implicit assumptions and meaning?  

8. The paper focuses on debating forums for collecting counter-arguments in text. What changes would be needed to adapt the approach to verbal debate and counter-argument generation?

9. The related work touches on recent advances like prompt-tuning and long-context models. How might integrating these enhance the proposed counter-argument generation pipeline?

10. What are some potential negative societal impacts if counter-argument models become very advanced? How can researchers anticipate and address ethical concerns early in development?
