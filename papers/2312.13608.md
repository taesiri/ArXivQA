# [Argue with Me Tersely: Towards Sentence-Level Counter-Argument   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13608)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Counter-argument generation seeks to automatically generate opposing viewpoints to input arguments. Prior work has focused on paragraph-level generation, but sentence-level generation poses unique challenges due to space constraints.  
- Evaluating counter-arguments is difficult using only n-gram similarity metrics like BLEU, since counter-arguments can be correct but lexically dissimilar.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce ArgTersely, a new benchmark dataset for sentence-level counter-argument generation, derived from human-annotated Reddit conversations.
- Propose Arg-LlaMA, a framework for high-quality counter-argument generation. It uses a pipeline with:
   1) Instruction components with reasoning templates for common argument errors
   2) An instructed language model (LLaMA-7B) fine-tuned using the instructions
   3) A BERT-based filter model to select the best counter-argument
- Propose two new automatic evaluation metrics:
   1) ChatGPT Eval: Uses ChatGPT to score stance opposition and argument completeness
   2) Arg-Judge: A BERT model trained to score counter-arguments based on human preferences
- Perform comprehensive experiments comparing to baselines like GPT-3, and do ablation studies to validate the approach.

Main Contributions:
- First human-annotated benchmark for sentence-level counter-argument generation
- Novel framework Arg-LlaMA that generates high-quality counter-arguments
- Introduction of model-based automatic evaluation metrics ChatGPT Eval and Arg-Judge, which are shown to correlate well with human judgement

The paper makes solid contributions in creating datasets, models and evaluation methods to advance the task of sentence-level counter-argument generation.
