# [Dynamic embedded topic models and change-point detection for exploring   literary-historical hypotheses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13905)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to reproduce and extend a humanistic hypothesis from comparative literature about semantic shifts in the meaning of the word "figura" from abstract to concrete and then to both senses between classical Latin and early Christian Latin. More broadly, the goal is to develop unsupervised methods for surfacing relevant linguistic phenomena and deriving humanistic insights about shifts in Latin language over time.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel combination of dynamic embedded topic models (DETM) and change-point detection to track topics and semantic changes over time in a Latin corpus spanning 250 BCE to 500 CE. The DETM is initialized with skip-gram embeddings and fit to the corpus to learn topic distributions. Then, change-point detection is used on each word's sequence of "bimodality" scores (even distribution over two topics) to find the most prominent shift indicating a change from one sense to two senses. Other semantic change measures like author "novelty" are also extracted.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel unsupervised framework combining DETM and change-point detection to surface semantic shifts 
- Demonstrates exploratory analysis methods to relate the model outputs to traditional scholarship
- Provides both high-level insights about standardization of Latin in early Christian era as well as specific hypothesized semantic shifts for words like "figura"
- Establishes ability to surface historically distinctive authors and vocabulary as a basis for future work involving closer collaboration with humanists

The paper concludes by discussing extensions like incorporating Greek sources, developing methods to handle noisier OCR corpora, and building interactive interfaces for scholars.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel combination of dynamic embedded topic models and change-point detection to explore patterns of semantic change in Latin texts across the Classical and early Christian eras, demonstrating methods to relate computational findings to traditional literary-historical scholarship.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content in the introduction section, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a novel combination of unsupervised machine learning methods (dynamic embedded topic models and change-point detection) for surfacing relevant phenomena in exploring shifts in Latin language over time.

2) Demonstrating viewpoints on model output that move readily between general trends and specific observations. For example, looking at overall word bimodality shifts over time as well as detailed topic evolutions for individual words like "figura".

3) Deriving legible humanistic insights and lines of inquiry regarding shifts in Latin language through the Classical and early Christian periods. For example, observing that Christian writers standardized language along with religion and analyzing the semantic shifts of words like "figura" that are relevant for literary-historical hypotheses.

In summary, the main contribution is using a combination of unsupervised methods to explore and characterize patterns of diachronic change in Latin in order to relate them to traditional scholarship in fields like Comparative Literature and Classics.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Dynamic embedded topic models
- Change-point detection
- Diachronic change
- Lexical semantic modality
- Classical Latin
- Early Christian Latin 
- Bimodality
- Word sense disambiguation
- Topic models
- Topic evolution
- Novelty
- Figura
- Effigies

The paper presents a novel combination of dynamic embedded topic models and change-point detection to analyze diachronic changes in lexical semantic modality in Latin texts from the classical period through the early Christian era. Key goals are characterizing semantic shifts over time, detecting change points, and exploring literary-historical hypotheses like the concept of "bimodality" and Auerbach's ideas about terms like "figura." The analysis looks at patterns in topic models and word distributions to assess phenomena like novelty and standardization in early Christian texts. So those are some of the central keywords and concepts. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel combination of dynamic embedded topic models and change-point detection. What are the advantages of this combination over using either method independently? How do the two methods complement each other?

2. The paper defines a word's "bimodality" to quantify changes in modality over time. What are the limitations of this simplification to two modalities? How could the definition be extended to capture more complex semantic shifts? 

3. The paper finds an overall decrease in semantic change starting in the early Christian era. What are some potential explanations for this stabilization? Could it be an artifact of the corpus or methods?

4. The paper highlights some very novel authors like Apicius and Vitruvius writing on specialized topics. What techniques could help distinguish topic novelty from stylistic or domain-specific novelty in an unsupervised way?

5. The paper shows how the meaning of "figura" evolves over time. What other words exhibit complex diachronic changes across multiple topics? What characterizations or visualizations could better capture this complexity? 

6. The paper suggests the early Church adapted vocabulary like "auster" and "cicatrix" for religious meanings. What evidence beyond distributional semantics could substantiate this directionality of adaptation?

7. The paper finds Terence has low novelty, contrasting with views of his clear and standard Latin. How could stylistic factors like lexical richness be incorporated to better contextualize novelty scores?

8. The paper notes challenges applying the method to noisier corpora like HathiTrust. What steps for corpus construction, cleaning, and filtering would be most impactful to enable this approach on such corpora?

9. The early Church is argued to have defined orthodoxy and created linguistic stability. What quantitative notions of linguistic stability, consistency, or conformity could test this hypothesis?

10. The paper focuses on Latin but suggests extensions to Greek. What challenges arise in mapping between languages and contexts? Could the methods apply to multilingual corpora?
