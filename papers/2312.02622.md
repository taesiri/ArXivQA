# [On the Initialization of Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02622)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper analyzes the variance of forward and backward propagation in graph neural networks (GNNs) and proposes a new initialization method called Virgo to stabilize it. The authors show that variance instability in GNNs comes from the combined effect of the activation function, hidden dimension, graph structure and message passing. They decompose the variance into sums over message paths and weight paths, deriving expressions in terms of the weight matrix variances. Based on this, Virgo minimizes the difference in overall variance between successive layers by appropriately setting the variance of the weight matrix sampling distribution. Through experiments on node classification, link prediction and graph classification across 15 datasets, they demonstrate that Virgo leads to improved model performance and more stable variance compared to methods like Xavier and Lecun initializations that do not account for the unique characteristics of GNNs. The proposed Virgo method provides a graph-structure-aware initialization scheme that is better suited for GNN optimization.
