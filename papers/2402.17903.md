# [Surgment: Segmentation-enabled Semantic Search and Creation of Visual   Question and Feedback to Support Video-Based Surgery Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17903)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Videos are important learning materials for surgical trainees, but the video watching experience tends to be passive with limited interactivity and feedback. Prior techniques to enhance video learning focus on extracting procedures rather than helping discern visual components within a frame, and do not easily generalize to surgery videos with subtle scene changes. There is a need for techniques that help create interactive exercises with visual feedback based on surgery videos to improve learning.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose Surgment, a web-based system to help expert surgeons create visual questions and feedback based on authentic surgery videos to enhance trainees' learning. Surgment is powered by a scene segmentation pipeline (SegGPT+SAM) that accurately differentiates regions in surgery video frames. Based on the segmentation, Surgment provides two key features:

1) A search-by-mask tool that allows searching for frames by adjusting size/position of segmented regions to express desired scene composition. This helps quickly retrieve frames of interest. 

2) A quiz-maker tool to create multiple-choice questions, "extract a component" questions, and "draw a path" questions targeting structures and tools. It also allows easy visual feedback attachment to frame regions.

Key Contributions:

- A surgery video scene segmentation pipeline (SegGPT+SAM) that achieves high accuracy (F1 score of 0.92) by combining strengths of two models

- Novel search-by-mask interaction for semantic and efficient searching/navigation of surgery videos 

- Diverse question types (multiple-choice, extract component, draw path) targeting anatomical, tool handling and decision making skills

- Easy visual feedback attachment to frame regions to enhance learning

- Evaluation with 11 expert surgeons shows surgeons can use Surgment to create high-value educational materials and consider it a valuable complement to existing training approaches

The key ideas are leveraging accurate scene segmentation to enable semantic search and easy visual question/feedback creation for surgery video learning.
