## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Developing domain-specific AI models for medicine requires substantial labeled data and task-specific models have limited generalizability. This hinders advancing AI in medicine.  
- Medical data comes in diverse modalities (text, images, etc.) with unique properties, making developing unified foundation models challenging.

Proposed Solution - OpenMEDLab Platform
- Provides open access to variety of medical foundation models covering text, images, protein data to serve as base for building clinical AI applications. 
- Includes pioneering techniques for adapting foundation models to medicine via prompting, fine-tuning with labels or self-supervised pretraining on medical data.
- Contains large-scale medical datasets, benchmarks and model evaluation metrics to drive foundation model research.

Key Contributions:
- Releases over 10 medical foundation models spanning language, imaging, protein domains.
- Showcases techniques to adapt models via prompting and fine-tuning for clinical diagnosis/segmentation. 
- Provides large datasets for pretraining and downstream tasks.
- Includes benchmarks to evaluate model adaptation methods.
- Establishes platform as collaboration between top institutes to open source models/data to advance medical AI.

In summary, the paper proposes the OpenMEDLab platform to open source medical foundation models and techniques to adapt them to clinical applications. This facilitates building medical AI systems with less labeled data and customized effort. The platform aims to serve as a valuable resource to standardize and advance medical foundation model research.
