# [Airavata: Introducing Hindi Instruction-tuned LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15006)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is limited support for Indian languages in recently launched large language models (LLMs) like Llama 2, Mistral etc. Performance in Indian languages is far behind English.
- There is a lack of open ecosystems of tools, models and datasets to foster research and innovation in Indian languages. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors collaborate with Sarvam AI to launch OpenHathi, an open LLM for Hindi based on Llama 2 architecture.
- They create an instruction tuning dataset for Hindi by translating high quality English datasets using IndicTrans2 machine translation model. The final dataset contains 385K examples.
- Using this dataset, they fine-tune OpenHathi to create Airavata, an instruction-tuned LLM for Hindi focused on assistive tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Release Airavata, an open instruction-tuned LLM for Hindi 
- Release the instruction tuning dataset used to create Airavata to enable further research
- Evaluate Airavata on NLU and NLG tasks - it outperforms OpenHathi on most tasks
- Compare multiple LLMs via human evaluation - Airavata lags behind ChatGPT and GPT-4 but outperforms other models in generating natural Hindi
- Analyze performance across diverse abilities like providing opinions, summarization etc. - potential areas of improvement identified

The paper makes an important contribution towards creating an open ecosystem for Indian language LLMs by releasing datasets, models and benchmarks to facilitate further research in this area.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces Airavata, an open-source instruction-tuned Hindi language model built by fine-tuning the OpenHathi model using diverse Hindi instruction tuning datasets, and benchmarks its performance across various natural language understanding and generation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the release of Airavata, an open-source instruction-tuned language model for Hindi. Specifically:

- They create and release a new instruction tuning dataset for Hindi containing over 150k examples by translating high-quality English instruction tuning datasets.

- They use this dataset to fine-tune the OpenHathi model, an existing open-source foundation model for Hindi, to create Airavata. 

- They evaluate Airavata on a variety of natural language understanding and generation tasks in Hindi and find it outperforms prior open-source Hindi models.

- They compile Hindi evaluation benchmarks and perform human evaluations to compare Airavata against commercial models like ChatGPT and GPT-4. The results show Airavata lags behind but demonstrates promising performance for an early open-source Hindi model.

- They release Airavata along with the instruction tuning dataset, evaluation suite, and code to enable further research into developing instruction-tuned models for Indian languages.

In summary, the main contribution is the creation and open-sourcing of Airavata, a new instruction-tuned language model to advance research into high-quality generative models for Hindi and other Indian languages.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper relies on translating high-quality English instruction tuning datasets into Hindi for training. What are some potential issues with this approach and how can the quality of translation be further improved?

2. The paper performs parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRA. What is the impact of using full fine-tuning instead and why was LoRA chosen? 

3. The paper uses a mixture of datasets for instruction tuning like FLAN, Anthropic, Dolly etc. What was the rationale behind choosing this specific mixture? Could a different mixture have led to better performance?

4. The model selection involves checkpoint averaging based on performance on dev sets. What other automated approaches could have been used for optimal checkpoint selection? 

5. The paper reports a gap between English and Hindi performance even after translation of test sets. What techniques can be used to improve cross-lingual transfer between English and Hindi?

6. The human evaluation uses a limited set of 50 prompts. How can more thorough human evaluation be conducted to better analyze model capabilities and failure modes? 

7. The model struggles with creative language generation tasks. What modifications can be made to the instruction tuning datasets to improve language creativity?

8. What other model architectures could have been explored for instruction tuning apart from using the OpenHathi model directly?

9. How robust is the model towards generating harmful, biased or misleading content? What evaluation was done to analyze model safety?

10. The model is currently intended only for research purposes. What additional steps would be needed before it can be deemed safe and robust for real-world deployment?
