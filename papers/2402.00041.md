# [Spatial-temporal-demand clustering for solving large-scale vehicle   routing problems with time windows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00041)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) with many customers are hard to solve exactly due to the computational complexity. Existing metaheuristics that find high-quality solutions use most of their computation time searching for local improvements in a solution. As problem size increases, the number of possible improvements grows exponentially, limiting scalability.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a decompose-route-improve (DRI) framework to solve large-scale VRPs more efficiently. 

- In the decomposition phase, customers are clustered based on a spatial-temporal-demand (STD) similarity metric that incorporates location, time windows and demand information to reflect the VRP objective and constraints. The metric groups customers that are more likely to be efficiently routed together.

- The clusters form separate sub-VRPs that are independently solved using any suitable algorithm in the routing phase. 

- In the improvement phase, local search focuses on resolving unfavorable routing decisions between subproblems, using the STD similarity to prune the search space.

Main Contributions:

1. Formulation of a novel STD similarity metric for clustering to effectively decompose large VRPs into more tractable subproblems, enabling better scalability.

2. Tuning of DRI hyperparameters based on problem attributes like size and customer/vehicle characteristics, to reduce complexity and generate quality solutions faster across various distribution scenarios. 

3. Demonstration that the data-driven decomposition and local search outperforms classic spatial clustering and rule-based search limitation techniques.

4. Benchmarking showing the DRI framework scales state-of-the-art metaheuristics like the Hybrid Genetic Search to efficiently solve large-scale VRP instances in short computation times.
