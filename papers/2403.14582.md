# [Large Language Models for Multi-Choice Question Classification of   Medical Subjects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14582)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Automatic question answering (QA) in the medical domain is challenging due to the complexity of medical subjects. 
- Existing models struggle to accurately classify medical multiple-choice questions into their respective subjects. The state-of-the-art baseline on the MedMCQA dataset can only answer 47% of questions correctly.

Proposed Solution:
- Fine-tune a large language model called Sentence-BERT using a Multi-Question (MQ) Sequence approach to encode semantics and context from medical multiple choice questions.
- Input a sequence of multiple questions into the model and extract a feature embedding for each question. 
- Fine-tune the model on the MedMCQA dataset to classify questions by medical subject.

Main Contributions:  
- Proposes a Multi-Question Sequence-BERT method to encode multiple medical MCQs into embedding features for classification.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy of 68% on the MedMCQA dev set and 60% on the test set, outperforming previous baselines.  
- Demonstrates the capability of fine-tuned large language models for complex multi-classification QA tasks in the healthcare domain.
- Visualizations show the model can distinguish between the 21 medical subjects based on the learned embeddings.
- Sets strong baseline for question classification without using additional context, motivating future work to incorporate context.

In summary, the key innovation is a MQ-SequenceBERT approach to effectively encode semantics from sequences of medical multiple choice questions for state-of-the-art classification accuracy on a challenging real-world medical QA dataset.
