# [GamutMLP: A Lightweight MLP for Color Loss Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11743)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question is how to recover wide-gamut RGB color values that were lost due to gamut reduction when converting from the ProPhoto RGB color space to the sRGB color space. Specifically, the paper aims to address the problem of restoring the original colors that were clipped and lost when reducing the image gamut from ProPhoto to sRGB. The main hypothesis is that a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model can be optimized to predict the missing color values when given the gamut-reduced sRGB image and spatial coordinates as input.

The key points are:

- Images are often processed in a wide-gamut space like ProPhoto RGB but stored in the smaller sRGB gamut, requiring gamut reduction where colors are clipped. This loses color information.

- The paper proposes optimizing a lightweight MLP model to predict the missing colors during gamut reduction from ProPhoto to sRGB. 

- The MLP takes the gamut-reduced sRGB values and coordinates as input and predicts the clipped ProPhoto RGB values.

- This allows "color recovery virtually for free" by embedding the small MLP model into the sRGB image metadata.

- Experiments show the MLP approach outperforms gamut expansion networks and other techniques for recovering the lost wide-gamut color values.

So in summary, the main research question is how to restore wide-gamut color information lost when reducing gamut from ProPhoto to sRGB, which is addressed using a compact MLP model optimized for color recovery.
