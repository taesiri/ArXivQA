# [GamutMLP: A Lightweight MLP for Color Loss Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11743)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question is how to recover wide-gamut RGB color values that were lost due to gamut reduction when converting from the ProPhoto RGB color space to the sRGB color space. Specifically, the paper aims to address the problem of restoring the original colors that were clipped and lost when reducing the image gamut from ProPhoto to sRGB. The main hypothesis is that a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model can be optimized to predict the missing color values when given the gamut-reduced sRGB image and spatial coordinates as input.

The key points are:

- Images are often processed in a wide-gamut space like ProPhoto RGB but stored in the smaller sRGB gamut, requiring gamut reduction where colors are clipped. This loses color information.

- The paper proposes optimizing a lightweight MLP model to predict the missing colors during gamut reduction from ProPhoto to sRGB. 

- The MLP takes the gamut-reduced sRGB values and coordinates as input and predicts the clipped ProPhoto RGB values.

- This allows "color recovery virtually for free" by embedding the small MLP model into the sRGB image metadata.

- Experiments show the MLP approach outperforms gamut expansion networks and other techniques for recovering the lost wide-gamut color values.

So in summary, the main research question is how to restore wide-gamut color information lost when reducing gamut from ProPhoto to sRGB, which is addressed using a compact MLP model optimized for color recovery.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a lightweight MLP-based method called GamutMLP to recover wide-gamut color values that are lost when images are converted from a wide-gamut color space (e.g. ProPhoto RGB) to a small-gamut color space (e.g. sRGB). 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposes to optimize a small MLP network during the gamut reduction step to predict the clipped color values. The MLP takes the reduced color values and coordinates as input. 

- The optimized lightweight MLP requires only 23KB of storage, allowing it to be embedded in the sRGB image metadata. 

- At inference time, the MLP can be extracted to recover the lost wide-gamut color values.

- Demonstrates that optimizing a lightweight MLP per image significantly outperforms conventional methods and pretrained DNN models for gamut expansion.

- Introduces a new dataset of 2200 wide-gamut and small-gamut image pairs for training and evaluation.

In summary, the main contribution is a highly efficient and effective MLP-based approach to recover color information lost when converting from wide-gamut to small-gamut color spaces. The compact size allows the MLP to be saved with the image for high fidelity color recovery.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point of the paper:

The paper proposes a lightweight neural network approach called GamutMLP that can recover wide-gamut color values in sRGB images that were lost due to gamut clipping when converting from a wide-gamut to small-gamut color space.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on recovering wide-gamut color values from sRGB images:

- It takes a different approach than prior methods by optimizing a lightweight neural network model (MLP) during the gamut reduction step to predict the original wide-gamut values. This allows the model to be saved with the sRGB image and used later for color recovery. Most prior works train a model beforehand on an external dataset.

- The proposed GamutMLP model only requires 23KB of storage. This is much more compact than typical deep neural network models for this task. The small size allows saving the model directly in image metadata.

- Experiments demonstrate this approach outperforms prior methods, including pre-trained DNN models and other per-image optimization techniques like SIREN. The compact GamutMLP model provides comparable or better performance than larger neural implicit models.

- The optimized GamutMLP model can recover the wide-gamut colors in around 2 seconds per image. This is significantly faster than other per-image optimization techniques.

- The method is evaluated on a newly collected dataset of 2200 wide-gamut/sRGB image pairs. This provides a challenging dataset to advance research on recovering color gamut.

- The approach does not require camera-specific information or other metadata beyond the sRGB image. It aims to directly restore the clipped wide-gamut colors. This differs from RAW-space recovery methods.

In summary, the key novelty is using a compact MLP model optimized during gamut reduction and embedded in the sRGB image itself. Experiments demonstrate this outperforms prior techniques while requiring minimal storage overhead. The method provides an efficient way to recover color fidelity lost when encoding images to sRGB.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Test the GamutMLP approach on other types of images besides the dataset of RAW images used in this work. The authors suggest trying images captured directly in wide-gamut spaces like ProPhoto as well as JPEG images that underwent compression.

- Experiment with different model sizes and architectures for the GamutMLP. The 23KB model worked well but further optimization may be possible.

- Try using the GamutMLP framework for other related color processing tasks besides gamut expansion, such as color constancy, white balancing, and rendering raw images.

- Explore alternative loss functions when optimizing the GamutMLP model, beyond just L2 loss. Perceptual losses or adversarial losses may further improve results.

- Develop techniques to reduce the optimization time even further so it can be applied efficiently to video frames.

- Conduct user studies to quantify whether the improved color accuracy from GamutMLP leads to perceptually better image quality for viewers.

- Explore using the GamutMLP framework for expanding the gamut of legacy images that lack original wide-gamut source data.

- Investigate combining the GamutMLP approach with other metadata or dual-pixel approaches for enhanced RAW image recovery from sRGB images.

In summary, the authors lay out several interesting ideas for future work to further validate, optimize, and extend the GamutMLP method across different domains and applications related to color image processing and image restoration. Testing the approach on more diverse data and integrating it into full image processing pipelines seem to be the main suggested directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model called GamutMLP to recover wide-gamut color values that are lost when images are converted from the ProPhoto color space to the standard RGB (sRGB) color space. During the conversion to sRGB, colors outside of the sRGB gamut need to be clipped to fit the smaller gamut, resulting in lost color information. The authors optimize a tiny 23KB MLP model during the gamut reduction step to predict the original clipped color values. This lightweight MLP can be embedded in the sRGB image metadata. When needed, the model can be extracted to recover the wide-gamut colors, providing significantly better color recovery compared to conventional methods. The authors introduce a dataset of wide-gamut and sRGB image pairs and demonstrate the effectiveness of GamutMLP against several baselines. The compact size and fast optimization time (~2 secs) of their MLP model allows high-fidelity color recovery to be obtained with negligible overhead.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) model called GamutMLP that can recover wide-gamut color values from images that have undergone gamut reduction when converted from the ProPhoto color space to the smaller standard RGB (sRGB) gamut. Images processed in the wide ProPhoto gamut get clipped when converted to sRGB to fit the smaller gamut. The authors propose optimizing a small MLP model during this gamut reduction step that takes the sRGB values and spatial coordinates as input to predict the original wide-gamut ProPhoto values. The 23 KB MLP model is optimized in around 2 seconds per image and can be embedded in the sRGB image metadata. When the image needs to be converted back to wide-gamut, the MLP can be extracted and used to recover the original color values lost in gamut reduction.

The authors introduce a dataset of 2200 wide-gamut and sRGB image pairs for training and evaluation. Experiments demonstrate their compact MLP model provides significantly better color recovery compared to conventional gamut mapping methods, pretrained deep neural networks for gamut expansion, and other implicit neural representations. The MLP model optimization is fast and lightweight, allowing the parameters to be stored directly in image metadata. This provides an efficient way to recover rich wide-gamut color information from sRGB images.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model called GamutMLP to recover wide-gamut color values that are lost when images are converted from the ProPhoto color space to the smaller sRGB color space. During the gamut reduction step when converting from ProPhoto to sRGB, the GamutMLP model is optimized to predict the original ProPhoto values that get clipped/lost to fit the sRGB gamut. The MLP takes the sRGB pixel coordinates and color values as input and predicts the residuals that need to be added back to the sRGB values to recover the original ProPhoto colors. The GamutMLP model requires only 23KB of storage, so it can be embedded in the sRGB image metadata. When needed, the model can be extracted from the sRGB image to recover the wide-gamut colors. Compared to other methods, the GamutMLP approach provides better color recovery, while having a very compact model size and fast per-image optimization time.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key points from the paper are:

- The paper addresses the problem of recovering wide-gamut RGB color values that are lost when converting from a wide-gamut color space like ProPhoto RGB to a smaller gamut space like sRGB. 

- When converting from a wide ProPhoto gamut to the smaller sRGB gamut, colors outside of sRGB need to be clipped and compressed to fit the smaller gamut. This results in lost color information that is difficult to recover when converting back to a wide gamut.

- The paper proposes a method to optimize a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model during the initial gamut reduction step. The MLP model takes the gamut-reduced RGB values and predicts the original wide-gamut RGB values for those clipped colors. 

- The MLP model is very small (23 KB) so it can be embedded in the sRGB image metadata when saving the image. Later, when converting back to wide-gamut, this model can be extracted and used to recover the lost colors.

- Compared to prior work on using deep networks or other techniques for gamut expansion, the per-image optimized MLP provides better results for color recovery with a much smaller model size and faster optimization time (within 2 seconds per image).

In summary, the key contribution is a lightweight MLP-based approach to recover wide-gamut color information that is lost when saving common sRGB images, which still make up the majority of images today despite advances in display technology. The small model size allows embedding the MLP in the sRGB image for later recovery.
