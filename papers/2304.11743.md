# [GamutMLP: A Lightweight MLP for Color Loss Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11743)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question is how to recover wide-gamut RGB color values that were lost due to gamut reduction when converting from the ProPhoto RGB color space to the sRGB color space. Specifically, the paper aims to address the problem of restoring the original colors that were clipped and lost when reducing the image gamut from ProPhoto to sRGB. The main hypothesis is that a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model can be optimized to predict the missing color values when given the gamut-reduced sRGB image and spatial coordinates as input.

The key points are:

- Images are often processed in a wide-gamut space like ProPhoto RGB but stored in the smaller sRGB gamut, requiring gamut reduction where colors are clipped. This loses color information.

- The paper proposes optimizing a lightweight MLP model to predict the missing colors during gamut reduction from ProPhoto to sRGB. 

- The MLP takes the gamut-reduced sRGB values and coordinates as input and predicts the clipped ProPhoto RGB values.

- This allows "color recovery virtually for free" by embedding the small MLP model into the sRGB image metadata.

- Experiments show the MLP approach outperforms gamut expansion networks and other techniques for recovering the lost wide-gamut color values.

So in summary, the main research question is how to restore wide-gamut color information lost when reducing gamut from ProPhoto to sRGB, which is addressed using a compact MLP model optimized for color recovery.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a lightweight MLP-based method called GamutMLP to recover wide-gamut color values that are lost when images are converted from a wide-gamut color space (e.g. ProPhoto RGB) to a small-gamut color space (e.g. sRGB). 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposes to optimize a small MLP network during the gamut reduction step to predict the clipped color values. The MLP takes the reduced color values and coordinates as input. 

- The optimized lightweight MLP requires only 23KB of storage, allowing it to be embedded in the sRGB image metadata. 

- At inference time, the MLP can be extracted to recover the lost wide-gamut color values.

- Demonstrates that optimizing a lightweight MLP per image significantly outperforms conventional methods and pretrained DNN models for gamut expansion.

- Introduces a new dataset of 2200 wide-gamut and small-gamut image pairs for training and evaluation.

In summary, the main contribution is a highly efficient and effective MLP-based approach to recover color information lost when converting from wide-gamut to small-gamut color spaces. The compact size allows the MLP to be saved with the image for high fidelity color recovery.
