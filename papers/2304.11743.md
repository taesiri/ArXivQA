# [GamutMLP: A Lightweight MLP for Color Loss Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11743)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question is how to recover wide-gamut RGB color values that were lost due to gamut reduction when converting from the ProPhoto RGB color space to the sRGB color space. Specifically, the paper aims to address the problem of restoring the original colors that were clipped and lost when reducing the image gamut from ProPhoto to sRGB. The main hypothesis is that a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model can be optimized to predict the missing color values when given the gamut-reduced sRGB image and spatial coordinates as input.

The key points are:

- Images are often processed in a wide-gamut space like ProPhoto RGB but stored in the smaller sRGB gamut, requiring gamut reduction where colors are clipped. This loses color information.

- The paper proposes optimizing a lightweight MLP model to predict the missing colors during gamut reduction from ProPhoto to sRGB. 

- The MLP takes the gamut-reduced sRGB values and coordinates as input and predicts the clipped ProPhoto RGB values.

- This allows "color recovery virtually for free" by embedding the small MLP model into the sRGB image metadata.

- Experiments show the MLP approach outperforms gamut expansion networks and other techniques for recovering the lost wide-gamut color values.

So in summary, the main research question is how to restore wide-gamut color information lost when reducing gamut from ProPhoto to sRGB, which is addressed using a compact MLP model optimized for color recovery.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a lightweight MLP-based method called GamutMLP to recover wide-gamut color values that are lost when images are converted from a wide-gamut color space (e.g. ProPhoto RGB) to a small-gamut color space (e.g. sRGB). 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposes to optimize a small MLP network during the gamut reduction step to predict the clipped color values. The MLP takes the reduced color values and coordinates as input. 

- The optimized lightweight MLP requires only 23KB of storage, allowing it to be embedded in the sRGB image metadata. 

- At inference time, the MLP can be extracted to recover the lost wide-gamut color values.

- Demonstrates that optimizing a lightweight MLP per image significantly outperforms conventional methods and pretrained DNN models for gamut expansion.

- Introduces a new dataset of 2200 wide-gamut and small-gamut image pairs for training and evaluation.

In summary, the main contribution is a highly efficient and effective MLP-based approach to recover color information lost when converting from wide-gamut to small-gamut color spaces. The compact size allows the MLP to be saved with the image for high fidelity color recovery.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point of the paper:

The paper proposes a lightweight neural network approach called GamutMLP that can recover wide-gamut color values in sRGB images that were lost due to gamut clipping when converting from a wide-gamut to small-gamut color space.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on recovering wide-gamut color values from sRGB images:

- It takes a different approach than prior methods by optimizing a lightweight neural network model (MLP) during the gamut reduction step to predict the original wide-gamut values. This allows the model to be saved with the sRGB image and used later for color recovery. Most prior works train a model beforehand on an external dataset.

- The proposed GamutMLP model only requires 23KB of storage. This is much more compact than typical deep neural network models for this task. The small size allows saving the model directly in image metadata.

- Experiments demonstrate this approach outperforms prior methods, including pre-trained DNN models and other per-image optimization techniques like SIREN. The compact GamutMLP model provides comparable or better performance than larger neural implicit models.

- The optimized GamutMLP model can recover the wide-gamut colors in around 2 seconds per image. This is significantly faster than other per-image optimization techniques.

- The method is evaluated on a newly collected dataset of 2200 wide-gamut/sRGB image pairs. This provides a challenging dataset to advance research on recovering color gamut.

- The approach does not require camera-specific information or other metadata beyond the sRGB image. It aims to directly restore the clipped wide-gamut colors. This differs from RAW-space recovery methods.

In summary, the key novelty is using a compact MLP model optimized during gamut reduction and embedded in the sRGB image itself. Experiments demonstrate this outperforms prior techniques while requiring minimal storage overhead. The method provides an efficient way to recover color fidelity lost when encoding images to sRGB.
