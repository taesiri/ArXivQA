# [Recursively Summarizing Books with Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10862)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the table, the key points seem to be:

- The paper is evaluating different summarization models on metrics like BERTScore, ROUGE, and correlation with length.

- The models being compared include a 175B RL model, a 175B model trained only on the first subtree, and a smaller 6B model. There are also some extractive baselines.

- The central research question seems to be: How well can these recursive summarization models summarize entire books, as measured by automatic metrics compared to baselines and human performance?

- The 175B RL model achieves the best BERTScore, while the 175B first subtree model achieves the best ROUGE-2 and competitive BERTScore. 

- All the recursive summarization models outperform the non-oracle baselines on BERTScore, suggesting they are producing more abstractive and accurate summaries.

- The 175B models approach the performance of an extractive oracle on ROUGE, while significantly exceeding it on BERTScore.

- The recursive models do not yet match human performance on these metrics, but are making significant progress towards that goal based on the metrics.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that recursive summarization models can produce high-quality abstractive summaries of entire books, which the results seem to support based on automatic metrics. The key research questions are how the models compare to baselines and human performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be presenting progress on using human feedback and recursive task decomposition for abstractive summarization of long documents. Specifically:

- They apply task decomposition and human feedback to the challenging problem of abstractive book summarization. They decompose the long book summarization task into summarizing smaller chunks, and recursively summarize the chunk summaries.

- They collect a large volume of human demonstrations and comparisons to train a model (fine-tuning GPT-3) to summarize at each level of the decomposition through behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning. 

- Their resulting model can generate complete book summaries that contain important events and some abstraction, approaching human quality on a small fraction of books.

- The model summaries enable a QA model to achieve competitive performance on the NarrativeQA benchmark for answering questions about books.

- They achieve state-of-the-art results on the BookSum dataset for long document summarization.

- Their analysis shows that reinforcement learning on human comparisons leads to better summarization ability compared to just behavioral cloning, once the policy quality reaches a certain level.

In summary, the key contribution is showing that recursive decomposition and human feedback can scale to training models on very long and difficult summarization tasks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review, here is how I see this paper comparing to other research in the field:

- The paper introduces a novel approach for abstractive summarization of long documents like books by combining recursive task decomposition with reinforcement learning from human preferences. This is a fairly unique contribution compared to most prior work on summarization which focuses on short texts or extractive methods. The idea of task decomposition has been explored conceptually in some prior theoretical AI safety papers, but this work provides one of the first concrete applications to a difficult real-world task.

- The recursive summarization approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BookSum benchmark for long document summarization. It outperforms previous neural abstractive methods by 3-4 ROUGE points and also beats an extractive oracle on the BERTScore metric. This demonstrates the value of the proposed techniques compared to other summarization methods.

- For the reinforcement learning component, the gains over the BC baseline echo similar findings from past work showing the benefits of RL for text summarization. However, the analysis of RL's improved sample efficiency over BC with high-quality demonstrations is quite novel. This helps make the case for RL's practicality in real-world settings.

- The qualitative analysis of limitations reveals open challenges shared across most long document summarization work, like difficulty tracking entities and coreference. The conjecture that fiction may be inherently harder to summarize than non-fiction seems plausible but preliminary.

- The NarrativeQA evaluation demonstrates the broader value of the summaries for question answering, but is hard to directly compare due to using a much larger QA model. The zero-shot recursive QA results are intriguing but also hard to contextualize without comparison to other methods.

Overall, I find this paper to make solid incremental progress over comparable past work, while also introducing some new techniques and analysis to the field. The limitations show open research questions remain, but the approach appears promising. Let me know if you would like me to expand on any part of this comparison.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigating better and more principled curricula for training. They suggest ideas like generating the summary trees on-the-fly during training, and training the reward model online. They also suggest exploring the impact of different episode lengths during RL training.

- Improving the techniques for fine-tuning models using human feedback. The authors suggest exploring more efficient ways to collect comparison data instead of binary comparisons. They also suggest trying other human feedback optimization methods like expert iteration.

- Learning a task decomposition model rather than using a fixed decomposition. The authors suggest this could be feasible for hard real-world tasks, but it remains an open question.

- Further exploring what kinds of tasks are fundamentally limited by task decomposition, since it requires tasks to be separable. 

- Investigating other ways ML models could assist humans in specifying preferences and giving feedback for high-level tasks beyond summarization.

- Training an end-to-end model that maps from a full book to a summary, using distillation over the recursive model.

- Addressing the limitations of their current book summarization model, such as improving coherence and abstraction in the summaries.

So in summary, the main future directions are improving the training techniques like curriculum and human feedback methods, learning task decomposition, applying the approach to new tasks, addressing model limitations, and investigating the limits of task decomposability.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper examines the relationship between summary length, BERTScore, ROUGE metrics, and human ratings on book summaries generated by different models. They train recursive summarization models with behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning on summaries of increasing length, from paragraphs to chapter summaries to full book summaries. A key finding is that their 175B parameter RL model achieves the highest BERTScore of 0.182 on the BookSum dataset, outperforming extractive methods and large pretrained models. However, BERTScore has a slight negative correlation with length, so they run an adjustment to control for this. Even after adjustment, their model still achieves the top BERTScore. Their model also beats baselines on ROUGE metrics, approaching the performance of an extractive oracle. When evaluated by humans, their model summaries occasionally match human quality, with over 5% rated 6/7, although on average they remain worse than human summaries. They also show their summaries contain enough salient information to do competitively on the NarrativeQA question answering benchmark.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method for abstractive summarization of entire fiction books by combining task decomposition and learning from human feedback. The key idea is to recursively break down the book into smaller parts, train models to summarize these parts with human demonstrations and comparisons, and then recursively summarize the summaries. 

Specifically, the book is decomposed into a tree of summarization subtasks. Models are first trained on summarizing leaves of the tree (small sections of the book) using behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning against a learned reward model. Then models summarize concatenations of leaf summaries, and this process continues recursively up the tree until the entire book is summarized. Experiments show this approach can produce coherent multi-paragraph summaries of books. The resulting summaries contain important events from the book and sometimes synthesize details abstractively. Quantitative results significantly beat baselines, and a subset of summaries approach human quality according to human evaluation. The summaries also enable competitive performance on the NarrativeQA benchmark when used for question answering.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents an approach for abstractive summarization of entire books by combining recursive task decomposition with learning from human feedback. The method involves recursively decomposing the book into smaller sections, collecting demonstrations and comparisons from humans summarizing these sections, and training a model on this data. At test time, the trained model recursively summarizes parts of the book, and then recursively summarizes those summaries, until a summary of the full book is produced. The key aspects are using task decomposition to break the problem into more feasible subtasks that humans can provide feedback on, and training a single model that can be applied recursively for summarization at all levels. The main result is a model that can generate multi-sentence summaries for entire books by leveraging the human feedback collected on smaller sections of the books.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the tables and text, it seems this paper is investigating methods for summarizing long texts such as books. The main problem it is addressing is how to train machine learning models to perform long-form summarization when it is very difficult and time-consuming for humans to evaluate or provide training data for summarizing entire books. 

The paper proposes an approach that combines human feedback with recursive task decomposition. The models are trained to summarize short chunks of the book, and then recursively summarize these summaries to eventually produce a summary of the full book. This makes it more feasible for humans to provide training data.

The main findings seem to be:

- Their approach lets them generate plausible summaries for entire books by recursively summarizing parts. 

- A small number of summaries approach human quality, but on average they are significantly worse than human summaries.

- Training on just the first part of the book is sufficient for the model to generalize to full book summarization.

- Their model achieves state-of-the-art on the BookSum dataset and allows a QA model to perform competitively on the NarrativeQA benchmark.

- RL improves over BC, especially with more data. Comparisons are more efficient than demonstrations.

So in summary, the main problem is generating training data for long document summarization, which they address via recursive decomposition and human feedback.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords are:

- Length 
- BERTScore
- Correlation
- Slope  
- Adjusted BERTScore

The paper seems to be analyzing the relationship between the length of summaries and their BERTScore, which is a metric for evaluating the quality of text summaries. It reports the length, BERTScore, their correlation, the slope of the regression line relating length and BERTScore, and an adjusted BERTScore controlling for the effect of length. 

The different model summaries analyzed are:

- 175b full tree 
- 175b first subtree
- 6b full tree

The key findings seem to be that while there is a slight negative correlation between length and BERTScore, adjusting for this correlation does not significantly change the BERTScores. The 175b full tree summary gets the best BERTScore even after adjusting for length.

Some other potentially relevant terms based on the table structure are model size, training method (RL vs BC), and metrics like ROUGE and BLEU which evaluate summarization quality. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of the summary!

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The method combines task decomposition with learning from human feedback. Can you explain in more detail how the task decomposition works and how it helps make the problem more tractable? What are the key steps in decomposing the book summarization task?

2. The authors use both behavioral cloning (BC) and reinforcement learning (RL) to train the model. Can you compare and contrast how BC and RL are used? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method? Why use both?

3. The method recursively applies the trained model during data collection. Can you explain how this causes auto-induced distributional shift (ADS)? Why is ADS a challenge and how does the training curriculum address it?

4. The training curriculum prioritizes the "first leaves" and "first subtree." What do these terms refer to and why are they prioritized? How does focusing on early parts of the book tree help?

5. The model is trained on individual tree nodes but tested by composing the entire tree. How does this discrepancy affect the training strategy and results? Does it present challenges for optimizing the top-level task?

6. The authors argue that decomposition provides certain advantages over end-to-end training. Can you explain at least three of these advantages? Do you think they outweigh the limitations?

7. One limitation mentioned is that decomposition may be fundamentally unsuitable for certain tasks. Can you think of examples of tasks that would be challenging to decompose and why? When might systems without decomposition be preferred?

8. The paper decomposes books into chapters/chunks in a predefined way. Can you think of other potential decomposition strategies? What are the tradeoffs of learning to decompose vs using a fixed algorithm? 

9. The model is not explicitly trained to generate coherent, human-readable summaries. How might the training objective be modified to improve coherence while preserving accuracy?

10. The authors use a limited context window size due to compute constraints. How might summarization quality be affected by using a model with a larger context window? What challenges would this introduce?


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

The paper presents a method for abstractive summarization of entire books by combining recursive task decomposition with reinforcement learning from human feedback. The key idea is to break down the difficult task of summarizing a long book into smaller subtasks of summarizing chunks of the book. Models trained on the subtasks can then help humans provide training signals on composing those summaries into higher-level summaries. This recursive process continues until reaching a summary of the full book. They train a single model capable of summarizing at all levels using behavioral cloning on human demonstrations and reinforcement learning on human preferences between model outputs. The resulting model is able to generate sensible abstractive summaries for entire books, even generalizing to unseen books. It significantly outperforms extractive methods on the BookSum benchmark and enables a question answering model to achieve competitive results on the NarrativeQA dataset when using the summaries as input instead of the full books. The work provides a practical approach to training models on difficult tasks using human feedback.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a method for abstractive summarization of entire fiction novels using recursive task decomposition and human feedback. The approach involves recursively splitting the book into smaller chunks, collecting human demonstrations and comparisons on summarizing these chunks, and training a neural text generation model using this data. The same model is applied at each level of the decomposition tree to summarize chunks of text into shorter summaries. This allows scaling up to full book summarization, while keeping the individual tasks small enough for humans to provide useful training signal. The resulting system is evaluated on summarizing popular novels, and can generate multi-paragraph summaries that cover major plot points and themes. Quantitative analysis shows the approach outperforms baselines, and a subset of summaries approach human quality according to human evaluations. The summaries are also shown to be useful for question answering using the NarrativeQA benchmark. Limitations include lack of coherence and abstraction in the generated summaries. The work demonstrates that recursive decomposition combined with human feedback is a viable path for training models on difficult, large-scale tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using task decomposition and human feedback for training models on long-form summarization. What are some potential downsides or limitations of using a fixed task decomposition strategy like they do, compared to learning an optimal decomposition?

2. The authors use a simple recursive procedure to decompose book summarization tasks. Could more complex decomposition strategies like learned decomposition or incorporating hierarchical encoders help address issues like error propagation or lack of broader context? 

3. The paper argues their approach makes it easier for humans to provide training signals on difficult tasks. But does it actually reduce the total amount of human effort required, compared to end-to-end training or other methods?

4. The authors find diminishing returns and challenges with RL on higher-level tasks in the decomposition tree. What modifications to the training procedure could potentially improve results, like more on-policy data or better node sampling strategies?

5. For the NarrativeQA evaluation, the authors use the summarization model in a zero-shot setting to recursively summarize passages conditioned on the question. Could further finetuning or prompt-based techniques help optimize the model better for this downstream task?

6. The fixed decomposition strategy works for summarization but may not generalize well to other tasks. What kinds of tasks do you think would be most amenable to recursive decomposition strategies like this? Which tasks might it fundamentally struggle with?

7. The paper argues their summaries help trace model reasoning and debug errors compared to end-to-end models. But how easy is it for humans to truly understand model behavior given the complex emergent interactions between fine-tuned subtasks? 

8. Since models at each level are conditioned on possibly erroneous outputs from lower levels, how severe of an issue is auto-induced distribution shift? Could techniques like online learning or backpropagation mitigate adverse effects?

9. For most experiments, the authors sample tasks from just the start of books. How much does curriculum design account for the model's strong generalization to full book summarization?

10. The authors use GPT-3 style models, but summarization may be better suited to other architectures like BART or T5. How much would architectural differences affect the viability of their recursive human-in-the-loop approach?
