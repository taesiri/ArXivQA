# [Mining Gaze for Contrastive Learning toward Computer-Assisted Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06069)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Medical contrastive Gaze Image Pre-training (McGIP) to utilize radiologists' gaze patterns during routine diagnosis to improve contrastive learning representations for medical images. The key insight is that medical images with similar underlying semantics tend to elicit similar gaze patterns from radiologists. Thus, images with gaze pattern similarity can be treated as positive pairs during contrastive pre-training, in addition to the standard practice of using augmented views of the same image. The authors investigate different schemes to measure gaze similarity based on sequence and heatmap representations as well as image structure. Experiments on mammography and dental X-ray datasets with multiple encoders and contrastive learning frameworks demonstrate consistent improvements in downstream classification performance compared to standard pre-training approaches. The gains indicate that radiologist gaze can serve as an effective alternative to text reports for providing supervision signals. By seamlessly collecting gaze during diagnosis without interrupting radiologists' workflow, McGIP offers a practical plug-and-play module for creating better representations to advance computer-assisted diagnosis.
