# [Developing Autonomous Robot-Mediated Behavior Coaching Sessions with   Haru](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11569)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Social robots have potential for behavior change coaching, but prior work had limitations in terms of depth of interaction and naturalness of robot behavior due to reliance on wizard operators and virtual simulations. 

- Trust, engagement, and emotional expressiveness are critical for effective coaching interactions, but not well explored in autonomous robot dialogues.

Solution:
- The authors developed a new fully autonomous behavior change coaching dialogue for the social robot Haru to address prior limitations. 

- The dialogue is based on the Tiny Habits method and emphasizes Haru's emotional expressiveness through vocal genres, routines, empathy, and mimicry.

- It uses adaptive responses and entity capture for personalization and situation awareness. Error mitigation strategies also enhance user experience.

Contributions:  
- Demonstrated a fully autonomous emotionally expressive coaching dialogue, enhancing trust and engagement.

- Presented key dialogue design strategies: emotional expressiveness, empathy, situation awareness, personalization, error mitigation. 

- Showed statistically significant improvements in perceptions of Haru as more lively, interactive, less fake through user study (N=12).

- Provided practical insights and framework for future autonomous social robot dialogues, particularly for behavior change coaching.

In summary, the key innovation was creating an autonomous emotionally-intelligent coaching dialogue for the social robot Haru and demonstrating its effectiveness. The paper makes valuable contributions in human-robot interaction design, highlighting strategies for improving user experience and engagement.
