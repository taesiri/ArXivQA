# [Cooperation Does Matter: Exploring Multi-Order Bilateral Relations for   Audio-Visual Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06462)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the emerging task of audio-visual segmentation (AVS). AVS aims to segment all sounding objects at the pixel level in a video, requiring cross-modal understanding between the audio and visual modalities. This poses significant challenges in aligning the sequential audio signals to the 2D spatial visual features, exploring temporal dependencies between video frames, and extracting precise visual features.  

Method:
The paper proposes a novel audio-visual transformer framework called COMBO that explores three types of bilateral relations - pixel, modality and temporal entanglements.

1) For pixel entanglement, a Siam-Encoder Module (SEM) leverages prior masks from a foundation model to guide more precise visual feature extraction. 

2) For modality entanglement, a Bilateral-Fusion Module (BFM) performs bi-directional fusion between audio and visual features to align the signals from both modalities.  

3) For temporal entanglement, an adaptive inter-frame consistency loss exploits the inherent temporal coherence in videos.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes a SEM to transfer knowledge from foundation models for mining pixel entanglement.

2) Introduces a BFM for bi-directional audio-visual fusion that explores modality entanglement. 

3) Designs an adaptive inter-frame loss based on temporal coherence of videos to enhance temporal entanglement.

4) Achieves new state-of-the-art results on AVSBench object and semantic datasets, significantly outperforming previous methods.

In summary, the key innovation is in exploring three types of bilateral relations through specially designed modules for pixel, modality and temporal entanglements, which are shown to be highly effective for the AVS task. This provides a new direction for tackling cross-modal video understanding problems.
