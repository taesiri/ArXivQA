# [Cooperation Does Matter: Exploring Multi-Order Bilateral Relations for   Audio-Visual Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06462)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of this paper:

This paper proposes COMBO, an innovative audio-visual transformer framework for audio-visual segmentation (AVS). COMBO explores three types of bilateral entanglements within AVS: pixel entanglement, modality entanglement, and temporal entanglement. For pixel entanglement, a Siam-Encoder Module leverages prior knowledge from a foundation model to generate more precise visual features. For modality entanglement, a Bilateral-Fusion Module aligns visual and auditory signals bi-directionally. For temporal entanglement, an adaptive inter-frame consistency loss enhances coherence between frames. Comprehensive experiments on AVSBench datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with COMBO significantly outperforming previous methods. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of each proposed component. By simultaneously considering multi-order bilateral relations, COMBO sets a new benchmark for the emerging AVS task.
