# [Steerable 3D Spherical Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13863)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes a novel steerable feed-forward learning approach using spherical neurons to classify 3D point clouds in a rotation-invariant manner. 

- It focuses on deriving the theoretical aspects to achieve steerability and rotation invariance using spherical neurons, which have spherical decision surfaces obtained via conformal embedding.

- The key contribution is proving that the activation of a spherical neuron on a rotated input only varies by up to first degree spherical harmonics. This allows deriving a 3D steerability constraint for spherical neurons.

- The paper shows how to construct a rotation-equivariant filter bank from a pretrained spherical neuron classifier (called the ancestor network). By interpolating the filter bank outputs using the derived 3D steerability constraint, a rotation-invariant steerable classifier can be obtained.

- Experiments on synthetic 3D Tetris data and real-world 3D skeleton data verify the theoretical steerability constraint, demonstrating its correctness.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that using spherical neurons and the proposed 3D steerability constraint, rotation-invariant point cloud classification can be achieved. The theoretical analysis and experiments support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of a 3D steerability constraint for spherical neurons. Specifically:

- The paper proves that the activation of spherical neurons (hypersphere or geometric neurons) on rotated 3D input only varies by up to first degree spherical harmonics. 

- Based on this, the paper constructs a rotation-equivariant spherical filter bank using a tetrahedron basis and derives a 3D steerability constraint for spherical neurons. 

- The steerability constraint allows constructing a rotation-invariant classifier from a pretrained model with spherical neurons by freezing the parameters and adding interpolation coefficients.

- Experiments on synthetic 3D shapes and real 3D skeleton data validate the theoretical steerability constraint.

In summary, the paper provides a principled way to make spherical neuron models steerable and rotation-invariant by deriving and validating a novel 3D steerability constraint. This adds practical utility to prior work on spherical neurons and conformal modeling.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method to make classifiers with spherical decision surfaces steerable by deriving a 3D steerability constraint based on conformal geometry, constructing rotation-equivariant spherical filter banks using a tetrahedron basis, and interpolating the filter outputs to obtain rotation invariance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on steerable 3D spherical neurons relates to other research on equivariant neural networks and geometric deep learning:

- The paper focuses specifically on making spherical neurons steerable. Spherical neurons were proposed in prior work as conformal embeddings that yield higher-order decision boundaries. This paper builds on that by proving spherical neurons only need up to 1st degree spherical harmonics to accommodate rotations. 

- They derive a novel 3D steerability constraint and rotation equivariance properties for spherical neurons. This adds new theoretical understanding about achieving steerability for these geometric modules.

- Their method starts by training a normal network, then constructs a steerable version using analytically derived transformations. This differs from other approaches that constrain or regularize models during training to encourage equivariance.

- The work is mainly theoretical focused on steerability properties. The experiments validate the theory but practical use cases and performance comparisons are left to future work.

- Other related works like Cohen & Welling 2016, Weiler et al. 2018, and Fuchs et al. 2020 deal with steerable CNN models for images. This paper specifically targets 3D point cloud data.

- It relates to other geometric deep learning papers leveraging concepts like conformal geometry, but the focus here is on proving steerability as opposed to other tasks.

In summary, this paper provides novel theoretical results on the steerability of spherical neurons for 3D data. It differs from other works by analytically deriving steerability properties rather than learning them. The theory is validated but practical methods and applications still need to be developed in future work. The core contribution is the theoretical understanding enabling steerable geometric networks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper proposes a method to make spherical neurons steerable in 3D. The main future research directions suggested are:

1. Developing a practical way to determine the interpolation coefficients v^k(R). The paper focuses on the theoretical derivation of the steerability constraint, but determining v^k(R) in practice remains open. The authors suggest using a rotation regressor network to estimate R and then computing v^k(R) from it.

2. Extending the approach to build more complex steerable models. The paper shows steerability for spherical neurons in the first layer, but subsequent layers could use different architectures. As long as the first layer is steerable, the model outputs will be rotation invariant. 

3. Achieving permutation invariance. The paper's experiments use a simple MLP architecture without permutation invariance. But the authors suggest using ideas from PointNet to make the model permutation invariant while still being steerable.

4. Comparing to other rotation-invariant classifiers. The experiments validate the derived steerability constraint, but do not compare classification accuracy to other rotation-invariant methods. This comparison remains as future work.

5. Applying the approach to other feature spaces beyond scalars. The theoretical results could likely be extended to vector or tensor fields.

In summary, the main future directions are developing a practical way to determine the interpolation coefficients, building more complex steerable models, achieving permutation invariance, comparison to other methods, and extending the theory to other feature types. The core theoretical contributions provide a foundation for future practical development.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a novel approach for constructing steerable 3D neurons with spherical decision surfaces. The key ideas are:

- Spherical neurons, such as the hypersphere neuron and geometric neuron, have activations that are isometric under rotations of the input in 3D Euclidean space. This property enables deriving a 3D steerability constraint for such neurons. 

- The activations of spherical neurons under input rotation only vary by up to first-degree spherical harmonics. Therefore, a 3D steerability constraint can be derived using a basis of 4 rotated copies of the neuron arranged at the vertices of a tetrahedron. 

- The authors prove a theorem showing that the filter bank outputs of these spherical neurons are equivariant to 3D rotations. By interpolating these outputs using coefficients based on the input rotation, steerability is achieved.

- Experiments on synthetic 3D shapes and real 3D skeleton data empirically validate the derived 3D steerability constraint, showing invariance of the model outputs to rotations when the interpolation coefficients are computed using the ground truth rotations.

In summary, the paper introduces a principled geometric framework for constructing steerable feedforward networks using spherical neuron building blocks. The theoretical results lay the foundation for developing practical rotation-invariant networks in future work.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new approach for making 3D point cloud classifiers invariant to rotations. The method involves using spherical decision surfaces, known as spherical neurons, in the first layer of a neural network model. After training a base model (called the ancestor model) on point clouds in a canonical orientation, the first layer weights are transformed into a filter bank that is equivariant to rotations. By interpolating the filter bank outputs using derived coefficients, the model can generate rotation-invariant predictions. 

The main theoretical contribution is proving that spherical neuron activations when computed on a rotated input can be expressed using spherical harmonics up to the first degree. This allows deriving a 3D steerability constraint to make the model rotation-invariant. Experiments on synthetic 3D Tetris data and real 3D skeleton data confirm that when the rotation is known, the proposed steerable model generates the same activations and predictions as the ancestor model on canonical data. This verifies the correctness of the derived steerability constraint. The work provides a principled way to construct steerable 3D point cloud classifiers, enabling rotation-invariant predictions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel steerable feed-forward learning-based approach for 3D point cloud classification. The key ideas are:

- Use spherical neurons, which have spherical decision surfaces, as building blocks. These can be obtained by conformal embedding of Euclidean space. 

- Train a model (called "ancestor") with spherical neurons to classify point clouds in a canonical orientation. 

- Use the learned parameters to construct a filter bank of spherical neurons oriented to the vertices of a tetrahedron. This gives a rotation-equivariant filter bank.

- Derive a 3D steerability constraint based on the filter bank. This allows interpolating the filter bank outputs to make the model rotation-invariant.

- Verify the approach on synthetic 3D Tetris shapes and real 3D skeleton data. Theoretical analysis and experiments confirm that the model can produce rotation-invariant classifications using the steerability constraint.

In summary, the paper shows how spherical neurons can be made steerable in 3D to achieve rotation-invariant point cloud classification. The key novelty is the 3D steerability constraint derived for spherical neurons.
