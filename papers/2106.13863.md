# [Steerable 3D Spherical Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13863)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- The paper proposes a novel steerable feed-forward learning approach using spherical neurons to classify 3D point clouds in a rotation-invariant manner. - It focuses on deriving the theoretical aspects to achieve steerability and rotation invariance using spherical neurons, which have spherical decision surfaces obtained via conformal embedding.- The key contribution is proving that the activation of a spherical neuron on a rotated input only varies by up to first degree spherical harmonics. This allows deriving a 3D steerability constraint for spherical neurons.- The paper shows how to construct a rotation-equivariant filter bank from a pretrained spherical neuron classifier (called the ancestor network). By interpolating the filter bank outputs using the derived 3D steerability constraint, a rotation-invariant steerable classifier can be obtained.- Experiments on synthetic 3D Tetris data and real-world 3D skeleton data verify the theoretical steerability constraint, demonstrating its correctness.In summary, the central hypothesis is that using spherical neurons and the proposed 3D steerability constraint, rotation-invariant point cloud classification can be achieved. The theoretical analysis and experiments support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of a 3D steerability constraint for spherical neurons. Specifically:- The paper proves that the activation of spherical neurons (hypersphere or geometric neurons) on rotated 3D input only varies by up to first degree spherical harmonics. - Based on this, the paper constructs a rotation-equivariant spherical filter bank using a tetrahedron basis and derives a 3D steerability constraint for spherical neurons. - The steerability constraint allows constructing a rotation-invariant classifier from a pretrained model with spherical neurons by freezing the parameters and adding interpolation coefficients.- Experiments on synthetic 3D shapes and real 3D skeleton data validate the theoretical steerability constraint.In summary, the paper provides a principled way to make spherical neuron models steerable and rotation-invariant by deriving and validating a novel 3D steerability constraint. This adds practical utility to prior work on spherical neurons and conformal modeling.
