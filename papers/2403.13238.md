## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating coherent 4D sequences with animated 3D shapes is challenging. Existing methods rely on skeleton-based motion control and have limited ability to generate continuity in detail. The goal is to generate high-quality 4D sequences with dynamic evolution of shape and color over time while balancing the tradeoff between 3D shape quality, appearance, and sequence coherence.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel framework to generate coherent 4D sequences under given conditions. The key ideas are:

1) An integrative latent mapping approach that unifies shape and color information into a joint latent space representation. This allows simultaneously modeling geometry and appearance within the same space.

2) A skeleton-free 4D sequence representation that extends the unified latent vectors along the temporal dimension. This compact representation captures the distribution of the entire 4D sequence.

3) An image-text conditioned latent diffusion model that operates on the 4D representation to generate intricate sequences with temporal consistency.

Main Contributions:

- Integrative latent mapping for unified modeling of shape and color in a joint latent space.

- Skeleton-free 4D sequence joint representation to efficiently correlate information along the temporal dimension.

- Frame coherent self-attention and conditional cross-attention in the diffusion model to improve coherence.

- State-of-the-art performance on tasks like 3D object generation, unconditional/conditional 4D sequence generation across multiple datasets.

The method balances shape quality, appearance and temporal coherence to generate high-quality coherent 4D sequences under given conditions. Experiments demonstrate the ability to produce intricate sequences with dynamic evolution of geometry and color over time.
