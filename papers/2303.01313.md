# [Weakly-supervised HOI Detection via Prior-guided Bi-level Representation   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01313)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel weakly-supervised framework for human-object interaction (HOI) detection that incorporates prior knowledge from the CLIP vision-language model. The key idea is to integrate the CLIP knowledge at both the image level, through an HOI recognition branch, and at the human-object pair level, through an attention-based knowledge transfer module. Specifically, the textual embeddings of HOI labels from CLIP are used to build an HOI knowledge bank, which guides the learning of discriminative HOI representations. The framework has a global branch for image-level HOI recognition and a local branch that classifies pairwise interactions and relatedness. To handle the weak supervisory signals, the model employs losses defined over the image-level labels as well as a self-taught loss for pruning irrelevant human-object pairs. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets demonstrate superior performance over previous state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods. The learned representations also exhibit strong generalization ability for rare classes and fine-grained interactions. By effectively incorporating and transferring knowledge from CLIP, the model provides an accurate and robust solution for weakly-supervised HOI detection.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a weakly-supervised human-object interaction detection method that incorporates prior knowledge from CLIP into the learning process through a bi-level knowledge integration strategy and a self-taught relatedness classification loss to effectively exploit image-level supervision and suppress noise from incorrect human-object pairings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are three-fold:

(i) The authors exploit the CLIP knowledge to build a prior-enriched HOI representation, which is more robust for detecting fine-grained interaction types and under imbalanced data distributions. 

(ii) They develop a self-taught relatedness classification loss to alleviate the problem of mis-association between human-object pairs. 

(iii) Their approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the weakly-supervised HOI detection task on both the HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks.

In summary, the key contribution is using CLIP knowledge to enrich the HOI representation and handle issues like imbalanced classes and noisy human-object pairs, leading to improved state-of-the-art results on weakly-supervised HOI detection.
