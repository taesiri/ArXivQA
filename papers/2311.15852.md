# [Exponential Auto-Tuning Fault-Tolerant Control of N Degrees-of-Freedom   Manipulators Subject to Torque Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15852)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel auto-tuning fault-tolerant control system for robot manipulators with multiple degrees of freedom. The system incorporates an actuator fault model and mathematical torque constraints to address control input limitations, modeling errors, and common actuator faults. The controller leverages a robust adaptive subsystem-based approach to achieve exponential stability and sustained performance, enabling the system states to closely follow desired trajectories under constrained, faulty conditions with uncertainties. A key contribution is the optimization of the controller gains using a customized version of the fast and effective JAYA swarm intelligence algorithm. Stability analysis confirms the uniform exponential convergence of the tracking errors. Simulation results for a 2DOF manipulator showcase precise trajectory tracking in healthy and various faulty actuator scenarios, superior to existing methods. Overall, the fault-tolerant controller is generically applicable to complex, industrial manipulators requiring fail-operational capabilities along with input protections.
