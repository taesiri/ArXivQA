# [Hufu: A Modality-Agnositc Watermarking System for Pre-Trained   Transformers via Permutation Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05842)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Pre-trained Transformer models are valuable assets but face threats of theft and unauthorized usage. Watermarking is an important technique to protect model ownership. 
- However, existing watermarking methods are customized for specific models/tasks, not unified across modalities. They rely on trigger samples which can be exposed.  
- The goal is to design a modular, trigger-free watermarking framework for Transformers.

Method - Hufu:
- Key idea: Leverage permutation equivariance in Transformers - model gives same output for permuted inputs if weights are correspondingly permuted.
- Thus a model can learn two sets of weights - one for normal usage, another (permutation of the first) for watermarking.
- Watermark by fine-tuning model on data with secret permutation P. Output features are restored by P^{-1 and matched to secret vector sk via a decoder. 
- Embed watermark in shadow model to make extraction robust even from stolen models.
- Extract watermark by feeding permuted input to model. Restore output order by P^{-1, decode with G to match sk.

Contributions:
- Discovered permutation equivariance property in Transformers, enabling two weight sets in one model.
- Designed Hufu - a novel, modular, trigger-free watermarking system for Transformers.
- Watermark relies on model structure rather than data triggers, hence more robust.
- Evaluated on Vision Transformers, BERT and GPT. Showed efficiency, perfect effectiveness, minimal impact on tasks, and robustness to attacks.
- With task/modality-agnostic design, Hufu is promising for unified IP protection of various Transformers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Hufu, a modality-agnostic watermarking system for pre-trained Transformer models that relies on the permutation equivariance property to embed watermarks via fine-tuning on specifically permuted data samples, enabling model ownership verification through extracting pre-defined secret features triggered by input permutation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Hufu, a modality-agnostic watermarking system for pre-trained Transformer models. Specifically:

1) Hufu exploits the permutation equivariance property of Transformers to embed two sets of parameters (one for normal use and one for watermark extraction) within the same model. This property ensures minimal interference between the two sets of parameters. 

2) Hufu embeds watermarks by fine-tuning the pre-trained model on a small set of permuted data samples. Watermarks are later extracted by feeding the model permuted inputs. The use of permutations makes Hufu modality-agnostic, task-independent, and trigger-sample-free.

3) Extensive experiments on vision Transformers (ViT, DINO, CLIP), BERT and GPT-2 demonstrate that Hufu meets key requirements of watermarking including effectiveness, efficiency, fidelity and robustness. This shows its potential to serve as a uniform intellectual property protection service for various Transformers.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of Hufu, a novel watermarking system that exploits permutation equivariance to embed modality-agnostic and task-independent watermarks into pre-trained Transformers.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Watermarking - The main focus of the paper is developing a robust watermarking system for pre-trained Transformer models to verify ownership. This involves embedding a watermark into the model that can later be extracted.

- Permutation equivariance - A key property of Transformers that enables embedding two sets of parameters in the model, one for normal usage and one for watermark extraction triggered by input permutation. This ensures minimal interference.

- Modality-agnostic - The proposed system works across modalities like vision, language, etc. since it depends only on the model structure rather than input data. This makes it generalizable. 

- Trigger-free - Unlike other watermarking schemes, this approach does not require special trigger samples for watermark extraction, making it harder to attack.

- Effectiveness - The watermark can be reliably extracted from watermarked models but not from unmodified models.

- Fidelity - Watermarking causes minimal impact on the model's performance on downstream tasks.

- Robustness - The embedded watermark survives various attacks like model modification, theft, and removal attempts.

In summary, the core focus is on an efficient, transparent, and robust permutation-based watermarking technique for Transformer models by exploiting their permutation equivariance. The system is cross-modal, task-independent and does not rely on triggers.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The permutation equivariance property enables embedding two sets of parameters in the model. Does this property have any connection to the model overparameterization or redundancy issue widely discussed recently? Is it possible to quantify or analyze the redundancy by permutation equivariance?

2. The threat model does not consider the case where the adversary obtains the permutation matrix. What are the difficulties for the adversary to find the correct permutation matrix and how does it compare with finding a trigger pattern?  

3. The decoder seems to play an important role in associating the main functionality and the watermarking functionality of the model. How is the decoder designed and trained to maximize this association? Are there any other ways to enhance the association?

4. Hufu claims to be robust against various attacks compared to trigger-based methods. What is the essential reason behind the robustness? Is it possible to formally analyze the robustness?

5. The shadow model is used during embedding but not extraction. What role does the shadow model play? Is it possible to simplify the framework by removing the shadow model?

6. How does the size of the embedding set affect effectiveness and robustness? Is there an optimal embedding set size? How does the convergence behavior change with the size?

7. How does Hufu guarantee 100% watermark rates during extraction? Are there any hyperparameters that critically affect the rates? How does the change of thresholds affect false positives and false negatives?  

8. The decoding vector is set to match a random secret vector $sk$. Is there any better way to generate $sk$? Does a specifically designed $sk$ enhance robustness?

9. How does Hufu handle multiple watermarks when disputes involve multiple parties? Should we allow multiple watermarks or ensure only one effective watermark?

10. The extraction requires black-box access to the model with permuted inputs. Is it possible to extract watermarks from model updates, gradients, loss, or other information leaked from training?
