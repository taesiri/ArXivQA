# [Focus on Hiders: Exploring Hidden Threats for Enhancing Adversarial   Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07067)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new adversarial training method called Hiders-Focused Adversarial Training (HFAT) that improves upon standard adversarial training approaches by not just focusing on worst-case adversarial examples but also on hidden threats termed "hiders." The authors demonstrate that concentrating solely on adversarial examples causes models to become confused by hiders - samples that were previously classified correctly but later misclassified. To address this, HFAT employs an auxiliary model to reveal the probable locations of hiders and provide an optimization direction to defend that region, preventing the model's repeated confusion. Additionally, an adaptive weighting mechanism is introduced to balance emphasis between hiders and adversarial examples depending on present need. Experiments across various datasets, network architectures, and defense methods demonstrate HFAT's ability to simultaneously provide stronger adversarial robustness and accuracy. The core novelty lies in rethinking the conventional adversarial training objective to account for threats beyond overt adversarial examples. By unveiling and protecting against insidious hiders, HFAT is able to achieve more reliable robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Hiders-Focused Adversarial Training (HFAT), a generalized adversarial training algorithm that improves model robustness and accuracy by preventing hidden threats from samples called "hiders" while also defending against adversarial examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It reveals that existing adversarial training methods excessively focus on worst-case adversarial examples while neglecting potential vulnerabilities hidden in secure regions, which compromises robustness and accuracy. 

2. It defines "hiders" as samples that are currently defended or correctly classified but become vulnerable in later training epochs, and redefines the min-max optimization objective to defend against both adversarial examples and hiders.

3. It proposes a new adversarial training strategy called Hiders-Focused Adversarial Training (HFAT) that employs an auxiliary model to reveal hiders and combines optimization directions from standard adversarial training and prevention of hiders, along with an adaptive weighting mechanism.

4. It demonstrates through extensive experiments that HFAT effectively mitigates threats from hiders and provides higher robustness and accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art adversarial training methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the concept of "hiders" to reveal hidden vulnerabilities neglected by existing methods, and developing the HFAT strategy to provide more robust and accurate adversarial training by defending against both overt attacks and hidden threats.

The paper proposes a new adversarial training method called "Hiders-Focused Adversarial Training" (HFAT) that focuses on defending against "hiders" - which are samples that are initially classified correctly or defended successfully but become misclassified or undefended in later epochs. Key ideas include using an auxiliary model to reveal hiders, an iterative optimization strategy, and an adaptive weighting mechanism to balance defense against adversarial examples and hiders. The goal is to improve both robustness and accuracy compared to standard adversarial training.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new definition of "hiders" to characterize samples that are initially defended or correctly classified but later fail. What are the key properties that distinguish hiders from adversarial examples and make them worthy of special attention? 

2. The iterative evolution optimization strategy simplifies the optimization problem by only considering defense against the worst-case hider in the next epoch. Why is optimizing against the worst-case hider in only the next epoch sufficient for overall robustness against hiders?

3. The empirical probability distribution is used to model the relative positional relationships between hiders, natural examples, and adversarial examples. What compelled the authors to use a Gaussian distribution for modeling rather than determining absolute positional information?

4. How does the introduction of an auxiliary model aid optimization for hider defense? In particular, what particular purpose does sampling the distribution and reverse training serve? 

5. How exactly does the adaptive weighting mechanism improve coupling between the standard adversarial training optimization direction and the hider prevention optimization direction from the auxiliary model?

6. The loss landscape visualization along the hider direction shows local peaks for standard adversarial training that are suppressed by the proposed method. What do these peaks represent and how does suppressing them enhance hider defense?

7. Why does directly including hider samples as data augmentation decrease robust accuracy, while the auxiliary model method improves accuracy? What complications arise from direct hider sample inclusion that are avoided?

8. The analysis shows the auxiliary model branch gains increasing weight over training progress. How does this highlight the growing importance of hider defense in later training stages? 

9. How easily could the overall framework and methodology extend to other adversarial training schemes besides the specific algorithms tested? What customization may be required?

10. If hiders pose no immediate threat, what factors motivated the development of a complex auxiliary modeling approach rather than simply periodically retraining the model?
