# [Improving Sentence Embeddings with an Automatically Generated NLI   Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15132)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recently, decoder-based large language models (LLMs) like PromptEOL have shown excellent performance on sentence embedding learning. However, PromptEOL relies heavily on fine-tuning with large manually annotated natural language inference (NLI) datasets. 
- The goal is to improve sentence embeddings learned in an unsupervised setting without needing large human-annotated datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- Automatically generate an NLI dataset using LLMs, by creating templates with premises and asking the LLM to generate entailing and contradicting sentences.
- Improve quality of generated NLI data by using few-shot learning - providing the LLM a few examples from a manual NLI dataset before asking it to generate more sentence pairs.
- Fine-tune PromptEOL on this automatically generated NLI dataset to produce high-quality sentence embeddings.

Main Contributions:
- Framework to automatically create NLI datasets for an LLM using zero-shot and few-shot learning. Experiments show few-shot learning produces better quality data.
- Fine-tuning sentence embedding model PromptEOL on this auto-generated data sets a new state-of-the-art for unsupervised learning on semantic textual similarity tasks.
- The model achieves scores comparable to supervised learning without needing any large human-annotated datasets.
- This demonstrates the promise of using auto-generated datasets to improve performance for unsupervised NLP tasks.

In summary, the key innovation is using few-shot learning to automatically create annotated NLI datasets of good quality to allow unsupervised fine-tuning of PromptEOL to achieve state-of-the-art sentence embeddings without human annotation.
