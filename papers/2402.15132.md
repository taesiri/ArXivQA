# [Improving Sentence Embeddings with an Automatically Generated NLI   Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15132)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recently, decoder-based large language models (LLMs) like PromptEOL have shown excellent performance on sentence embedding learning. However, PromptEOL relies heavily on fine-tuning with large manually annotated natural language inference (NLI) datasets. 
- The goal is to improve sentence embeddings learned in an unsupervised setting without needing large human-annotated datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- Automatically generate an NLI dataset using LLMs, by creating templates with premises and asking the LLM to generate entailing and contradicting sentences.
- Improve quality of generated NLI data by using few-shot learning - providing the LLM a few examples from a manual NLI dataset before asking it to generate more sentence pairs.
- Fine-tune PromptEOL on this automatically generated NLI dataset to produce high-quality sentence embeddings.

Main Contributions:
- Framework to automatically create NLI datasets for an LLM using zero-shot and few-shot learning. Experiments show few-shot learning produces better quality data.
- Fine-tuning sentence embedding model PromptEOL on this auto-generated data sets a new state-of-the-art for unsupervised learning on semantic textual similarity tasks.
- The model achieves scores comparable to supervised learning without needing any large human-annotated datasets.
- This demonstrates the promise of using auto-generated datasets to improve performance for unsupervised NLP tasks.

In summary, the key innovation is using few-shot learning to automatically create annotated NLI datasets of good quality to allow unsupervised fine-tuning of PromptEOL to achieve state-of-the-art sentence embeddings without human annotation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework to improve sentence embeddings by automatically generating a natural language inference dataset with a language model and few-shot learning, then using it to fine-tune PromptEOL.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contribution is proposing a framework to improve sentence embeddings without using large, manually annotated datasets. Specifically:

1) They automatically generate natural language inference (NLI) datasets using large language models (LLMs) and few-shot learning. 

2) They use the automatically generated NLI datasets to fine-tune the PromptEOL model for learning high-quality sentence embeddings. 

3) Experiments on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks show their method achieves state-of-the-art performance among methods using unsupervised learning, and gets close to supervised methods that use large manual NLI datasets.

So in summary, the key contribution is enabling unsupervised learning of high-quality sentence embeddings by automatically creating supervision from LLMs, rather than relying on scarce labeled data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes automatically generating an NLI dataset to fine-tune sentence embedding models like PromptEOL. What are the key ideas behind the automatic generation method? How is it different from manually created NLI datasets?

2. The automatically generated NLI dataset is created using simple prompts with an LLM. What are some examples of the prompts used? How were they designed to generate entailment and contradiction pairs?

3. The paper shows that few-shot learning improves the quality of the generated NLI dataset. Why is few-shot learning helpful in this context? What effect did increasing the number of shots have on the agreement ratio?

4. What was the evaluation process used to assess the quality of the automatically generated NLI dataset? What metrics were used and why were they appropriate? 

5. The generated dataset is used to fine-tune PromptEOL. Why is an NLI dataset useful for improving sentence embeddings from a model like PromptEOL? What is the contrastive learning objective?

6. What were the key results on the STS benchmarks from fine-tuning PromptEOL with the generated NLI dataset? How did it compare to supervised and unsupervised baselines?

7. The average STS score peaks at 10-shot learning. Why might additional shots beyond 10 not continued improving performance? What factors limit gains?

8. For the transfer tasks, fine-tuning on NLI did not seem to help. Why might NLI fine-tuning not transfer well to those tasks? What kind of datasets might transfer better?

9. What are some limitations of the current study? What are ideas for future work to address those limitations and build on the method?

10. The method does not leverage manually annotated data. What are some of the key advantages of methods like this that can work in a completely unsupervised setting? What other applications might this enable?
