# [WeatherProof: A Paired-Dataset Approach to Semantic Segmentation in   Adverse Weather](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09534)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing semantic segmentation models like Swin Transformers, ConvNeXT, and InternImage achieve state-of-the-art performance on clean images, but suffer significant performance drops when tested on images degraded by adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, or snow. This is mainly because current segmentation datasets like ADE20K and Cityscapes do not contain adverse weather images, so models trained on them fail to generalize.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces a new 174K image dataset called WeatherProof with accurate pixel-level semantic segmentation labels. It contains pairs of images capturing the exact same scenes - one under normal conditions and one with real adverse weather. Models can thus be trained to focus specifically on weather degradation. 

The paper also proposes a paired training approach to leverage this. Models are trained on both clean and weather images from the same scenes. This allows separating the tasks of adapting to novel scenes vs adapting to weather effects. Consistency losses pull feature representations to be weather-invariant. A CLIP injection layer provides language guidance about the weather composition.

Key Contributions:
1) WeatherProof dataset with accurately paired clear and real adverse weather images for segmentation
2) Paired training method to isolate weather adaptation from scene adaptation
3) Feature consistency loss and output consistency loss to learn weather-resilient representations  
4) CLIP injection layer for language-based weather guidance

Results:
The proposed approach leads to an 18.4% mIoU improvement over baseline models like Swin Transformers on adverse weather segmentation, without compromising performance on clean images. This demonstrates the ability to make segmentation models far more robust to real-world weather variability.
