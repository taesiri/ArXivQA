# [Rhoban Football Club: RoboCup Humanoid Kid-Size 2023 Champion Team Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00612)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper describes the Rhoban Football Club team's robot architecture, design, and algorithms for the 2023 RoboCup KidSize humanoid soccer competition. The goal is to build humanoid robots that can autonomously play soccer against other teams.

Robot Design:
The robots (called Sigmaban) have 20 degrees of freedom with custom mechanical parts, sensors, and onboard computers. Recent upgrades include 3D printed bumpers for impact protection and improved hip joint bearings. The CAD software and model are designed for convenient updates and simulation.

Vision and Localization: 
The vision system uses a neural network (YOLOv8) for detecting field markers, ball, and robots in camera images. The network is optimized to run efficiently on the robot's hardware using model compression (OpenVINO). Camera calibration and odometry integration enable localization on the field.

Walk Engine:
A new three-stage walk engine plans footsteps using reinforcement learning, plans center of mass trajectories by optimization, and computes whole-body inverse kinematics to produce joint space trajectories. This provides stability and versatility compared to the prior walk. However, planned velocities exceed some joint limits.

Strategy:
A kick strategy optimizer chooses kick type and target based on a Markov model of outcomes. A placement strategy assigns roles like kicker and supportive positions to the robots based on location and state. A monitoring tool provides real-time visualization and logs for strategy analysis.

Contributions and Conclusions:
In summary, the key contributions are in robust mechanical design, computer vision for localization, versatile walking based on optimization and reinforcement learning, and a modular software architecture to enable improvements. As a result, the Rhoban robots achieved strong performance and rankings in RoboCup 2023. The paper also outlines areas needing further improvement pointed out during the competition.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents Rhoban Football Club's robot architecture, improvements, and strategy that led them to become the 2023 KidSize soccer competition champion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1) An overview of the recent mechanical, software, and algorithmic upgrades made to Rhoban's kid-size humanoid robots for the 2023 RoboCup competition. This includes things like new bumpers, hip joint improvements, upgraded vision and perception with YOLOv8, a new reinforcement learning based walk engine, and upgrades to the strategy/monitoring systems.

2) Details on the new walk engine, which was completely reworked from their previous approach to use footsteps planning with reinforcement learning, center of mass trajectory optimization, and whole body inverse kinematics to generate stable walking motions. This seems to be a key contribution as it likely helped improve the robots' walking ability.

3) The introduction of their OnShape to robot URDF conversion tool called "Onshape-to-robot", which won the 2023 RoboCup software challenge. This allows streamlined transfer of CAD designs to robot models.

So in summary, the main contributions appear to be the documentation of the overall upgrades to the robots and the details provided on the new reinforcement learning based walk engine and Onshape-to-robot conversion tool. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions switching from RBDL to pinocchio as the rigid body dynamics library. What specifically does pinocchio offer over RBDL to justify this change? Does it provide better performance, more features, or something else?

2. In the section on footsteps planning with reinforcement learning, what was the rationale behind formulating the actions as tuples of (Δx, Δy, Δθ) clipped to an ellipsoid rather than a box? How does this encourage more natural movement patterns? 

3. When training the footsteps planning RL agent, TD3 is used as the algorithm. Why was TD3 chosen over other RL algorithms like PPO or SAC? What characteristics of the problem make TD3 well-suited?

4. For the center of mass trajectory optimization, why is the jerk term (dddot c) included in the objective function with a small weight rather than just optimizing over the ZMP tracking term? What benefit does penalizing high jerks provide?

5. In the swing foot trajectory section, what was the motivation behind having a plateau region in the vertical trajectory? How does this differ from using a smooth cubic spline and what advantage does it provide?

6. For the whole body inverse kinematics, soft and hard tasks are defined. What makes a task “hard” versus “soft” in this context and why have both types of tasks?

7. The paper mentions some limitations around actuator speeds being exceeded during walking. What techniques could be used to address this and properly consider actuator limits during trajectory optimization?

8. For the kick strategy section, what was the rationale behind formulating it as an MDP and using value iteration initially? Why not just do tree search from the start?

9. In the kick strategy tree search, how are collisions with teammates or opponents handled during action evaluation? What recursive computation is done there?

10. For the placement strategy, what considerations need to be made around consistency and agreement between the robots when doing a centralized roles assignment? How is oscillation avoided?
