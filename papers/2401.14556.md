# [Do Not (Always) Look Right: Investigating the Capabilities of   Decoder-Based Large Language Models for Sequence Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14556)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) based on causal language model (CLM) pre-training have shown impressive performance on many natural language understanding tasks. However, they lag behind state-of-the-art results on information extraction (IE) tasks like named entity recognition (NER) and aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) which are formulated as sequence labeling (SL) problems. It is unclear if this inferior performance on SL is an inherent limitation of LLMs or can be improved.

Proposed Solution:  
- Explore different strategies to enhance the SL capabilities of "open" LLMs like Llama2 and Mistral by allowing bidirectional information flow in decoder layers. Specifically, remove the causal mask (which prevents the model from attending to future tokens) from different groups of decoder layers in a layer-wise manner during fine-tuning.

Main Contributions:
- Show that removing causal mask from even 1 layer group leads to significant gains over fully masked model on SL tasks. Complete removal from all layers is not always optimal.
- Layer-wise causal mask removal results are competitive with SOTA models and outperform strong baselines like RoBERTa and instruction-tuned LLMs. 
- Analysis reveals the performance gains stem from model scale rather than architecture. Small scale decoder model does not benefit from causal mask removal during fine-tuning.

In summary, strategic layer-wise removal of the causal mask enables bidirectional context for LLMs, unlocking their potential for SL tasks competitive with state-of-the-art models. The scale of model parameters and pre-training data determines the usefulness of this approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper explores strategies to enhance the sequence labeling performance of large language models by allowing bidirectional information flow between decoder blocks through strategic layer-wise removal of the causal mask during fine-tuning, finding task-dependent performance gains over strong baselines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It explores strategies to enhance the sequence labeling (SL) performance of large language models (LLMs) like Llama2 and Mistral on information extraction (IE) tasks. Specifically, it investigates allowing bidirectional information flow within groups of decoder blocks by removing the causal mask in a layer-wise manner. 

2) It finds that strategically removing the causal mask from only certain decoder block groups during LLM fine-tuning yields substantial performance gains over removing it from all layers or keeping it in all layers. The optimal configuration is highly task-dependent.

3) It shows that with the right causal mask removal configuration, the "open" LLMs can match or exceed the performance of strong masked language model-based encoders and instruction-tuned LLMs on diverse IE tasks framed as SL.

4) It provides an analysis comparing encoder and decoder architectures on SL tasks when controlling for model scale, training data, and other factors. The results reveal the superiority of encoders at the same scale, suggesting the performance boost from causal mask removal in large decoders stems from scaling up.

In summary, the main contribution is a thorough investigation of strategies to unlock the sequence labeling capabilities of large decoder models by allowing judicious bidirectional context flow, yielding models that are competitive with state-of-the-art approaches on information extraction tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper explores strategies to enhance the sequence labeling performance of large language models. Why is sequence labeling an important capability to investigate for large language models? What are some key applications that would benefit?

2. The method involves removing the causal mask across decoder layers in different configurations during fine-tuning. Explain the intuition behind why allowing bidirectional attention flow could improve sequence labeling performance. What are the potential downsides?

3. The results show that removing the causal mask from only some of the decoder layers works better than removing it from all layers. Why might that be the case? What does it suggest about how information flows in these large decoder models?

4. For the ABSA dataset, the performance was actually worse when removing the causal mask across more layers. What might explain this anomalous result? How could you further analyze the model to understand why?

5. The paper compares layer-wise causal mask removal to strong baselines like RoBERTa and instruction tuning. When does layer-wise removal outperform these methods and why? When does it fall short?

6. For pre-trained small scale models, removing the causal mask did not improve performance. However, for large models it did. What factors related to model scale might account for this difference? 

7. If you could design additional experiments to further analyze why layer-wise causal mask removal improves sequence labeling, what specific analyses or interventions would you propose?

8. The method relies on using models like Llama and Mistral that are publicly available. What are the advantages and limitations of using these models compared to proprietary models from companies?

9. The paper focuses on information extraction tasks framed as sequence labeling. Do you think similar gains would be observed for other sequence labeling tasks like part-of-speech tagging? Why or why not?

10. The results are competitive with state-of-the-art models on some tasks. What further improvements could be made to close the remaining performance gap? What other techniques could be combined with layer-wise causal mask removal?
