## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great success in learning from graph data. However, GNNs may be trained on undesirable or low-quality graph data, which can degrade their performance and reliability. To address this, graph unlearning methods aim to efficiently remove the effects of unwanted data points from trained GNN models. Existing methods either provide approximate removal without guarantees or rely on full retraining which is inefficient. There is a need for reliable and efficient graph unlearning techniques.

Proposed Solution - GraphRevoker Framework:
The paper proposes a novel graph unlearning framework called GraphRevoker which provides efficient yet reliable removal of unwanted graph data. It consists of two main components:

1) Graph Property-Aware Sharding: This partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs while preserving graph structure and label distribution in each subgraph. This is achieved via a learnable neural graph partitioning approach with tailored objectives.

2) Graph Contrastive Sub-model Aggregation: This aggregates predictions from partitioned subgraph GNNs using a lightweight ensemble method enhanced with contrastive learning. It enables effective knowledge transfer from isolated sub-models.

Together, these components enhance model utility after unlearning while still allowing efficient retraining of only a small sub-model when unwanted nodes need removal.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the first reliable and efficient graph unlearning solution by combining neural graph partitioning with graph contrastive ensemble learning  
- Introduces custom objectives to preserve graph structure and label distribution when partitioning for unlearning
- Leverages graph contrastive learning to improve sub-model aggregation and system utility
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple graph datasets compared to prior arts

The proposed GraphRevoker framework significantly advances the capability for performing reliable and efficient unlearning directly on graph neural network models. By jointly optimizing the partitioning and ensembling phases tailored for graph data, it provides a complete graph unlearning solution.
