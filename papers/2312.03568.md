# [DocBinFormer: A Two-Level Transformer Network for Effective Document   Image Binarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03568)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes DocBinFormer, a novel two-level vision transformer (TL-ViT) architecture for document image binarization. The model employs a transformer encoder-decoder structure to capture both global context and local details from document images. Specifically, the encoder contains two transformer blocks - a global transformer that encodes patch-level features and a local transformer that encodes sub-patch-level features. This allows the model to understand relationships between distant areas of the document through the global transformer while still preserving intricate local details through the local transformer. The encoded bi-level representations are combined and passed to a decoder to generate the binarized output image. Extensive experiments on DIBCO and H-DIBCO benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with quantitative gains over prior CNN and ViT models. Key advantages include more robust handling of noise, artifacts and multi-scale text compared to CNNs, and more precise text localization than vanilla ViTs. The local transformer specifically addresses ViTs' limitations in encoding spatial hierarchies. By capturing both global context and local intricacies, DocBinFormer pushes state-of-the-art in document binarization.
