# [Foundational Moral Values for AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17017)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper argues that solving the AI alignment problem requires clear, defensible values that AI systems can align to. It presents five foundational moral values drawn from moral philosophy that are grounded in the basic requisites for human existence: survival, sustainable intergenerational existence, society, education, and truth. These values provide a framework for technical alignment work by giving clearer direction and also highlighting threats and opportunities from AI regarding humanity's ability to obtain and sustain these values. The paper shows support for these values from global philosophies, UN Sustainable Development Goals, and corporate tech ethics efforts. It also discusses implications and an agenda stemming from these values, including preventing harms and promoting benefits related to human survival, relationships, community, learning, and truth-seeking. Limitations are considered such as anthropocentrism and subjectivity, but overall the values are argued to be necessary foundations. The paper aims to advance the discussion of values for AI alignment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes five foundational moral values - survival, sustainable intergenerational existence, society, education, and truth - as necessary conditions for human existence, which can serve as a basis for aligning AI systems to benefit humanity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing five foundational moral values - survival, sustainable intergenerational existence, society, education, and truth - as a basis for aligning AI systems. The authors argue these values are necessary for human existence, find support across philosophical traditions, and provide a framework for considering threats and opportunities from AI. They suggest these foundational values can help specify targets for alignment work, guide development and governance of AI systems, and highlight key areas of consideration regarding the societal impacts of AI. The paper aims to advance thinking on the normative aspect of alignment by providing a set of human-centered values grounded in the requirements for humanity's continued thriving.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- AI alignment - Aligning AI systems to human values and intentions. A key problem in AI safety.

- Foundational moral values - The core, basic moral values needed for human existence. The paper proposes five: survival, sustainable intergenerational existence, society, education, and truth.  

- Language models - Large language models that the paper discusses alignment approaches for.

- Helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty - Values that have been proposed for aligning language models. The paper relates them back to the foundational values.

- Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - Goals set by the United Nations that implicitly encode philosophical values related to human flourishing. The paper shows how they connect to the five foundational moral values.  

- Corporate principles - Principles for ethical AI set by major technology companies. The paper categorizes them according to the foundational values framework.

- Specification - The process of moving from abstract, foundational values to more concrete and actionable principles for aligning AI systems.

- Opportunities and threats - Ways AI could help or harm the achievement of each of the five foundational moral values.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes 5 foundational moral values for AI alignment: survival, sustainable intergenerational existence, society, education, and truth. How were these 5 values identified and selected from the myriad of possible values? What criteria or philosophical grounding was used to establish them as foundational?

2. The authors claim these 5 values are irreducible and necessary for human existence. However, could one argue that some values implicitly include or rely on others, allowing them to be consolidated or reduced? For example, does society rely on survival, truth, and education?

3. The paper roots the 5 moral values in philosophical traditions and thinkers like Aristotle, Confucius, Jonas, and others. However, these traditions have very different cultural contexts. So how can we reconcile or adapt values from diverse traditions into universal foundations? 

4. If AI systems were built around these 5 moral values, what mechanisms could translate such abstract ideals into technical specifications and constraints? What risks might emerge from the subjectivity in making such translations?

5. The authors connect the 5 moral foundations to international laws, business practices, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. But couldn't these be explained by self-interest rather than endorsement of the foundations? Do they really imply philosophical commitment to the 5 values?  

6. The paper is clearly anthropocentric in focusing solely on continued human existence. Could the 5 foundations be expanded to consider moral obligations to other species or even AIs themselves? If not, how might we mitigate conflicts between human values versus other moral patients?  

7. The agenda proposed for AI highlights threats and opportunities related to each moral foundation. But could adhering strictly to these foundations also limit beneficial innovations in AI? How can we balance precaution with progress?

8. If groups and individuals will likely have very different interpretations of the 5 moral foundations, can AI systems possibly align to values that have multiple, conflicting meanings across users and societies?  

9. The paper claims application to specific cases will require further specification of mid-level and action-guiding principles. But who should be involved in deriving and validating such specifications from the abstract foundations? What processes could enable this responsibly and accountably?

10. The 5 foundations focus on survival of human societies. But even with AI aligned accordingly, could factors like climate change, nuclear war, or pandemics still undermine human civilization? Do we need safeguards beyond AI alignment to ensure durable realization of the foundations?
