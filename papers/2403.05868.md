# [Toward Understanding Key Estimation in Learning Robust Humanoid   Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05868)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate state estimation is critical for robust control of humanoid robots using learning-based policies. However, there is a gap in understanding how different estimation methods influence policy decision-making. 

- Key open questions: "Should estimations be explicit or implicit?", "Which variables should be estimated?", "How do estimations assist the policy in completing locomotion tasks?"

Methodology:
- Proposes an asymmetric actor-critic framework with autoencoder structure to learn policies. Actor estimates states and makes control decisions. Critic evaluates performance. 

- Explicitly estimates base velocity, heightmaps, body height. Conducts saliency analysis to quantify importance of each estimation.

- Compares policies with different combinations of estimations: velocity-only, top-2 estimations, full estimations, irrelevant estimation, implicit-only.

Key Results: 
- Saliency analysis shows base velocity is most important, followed by heightmaps. Body height and implicit encoding have minor influence.

- Velocity estimation significantly improves tracking accuracy and speed. Heightmap estimation enhances terrain robustness. 

- Policy with top-2 explicit estimations (velocity + heightmaps) achieves best overall performance in simulation and real-world tests.

Main Contributions:
- First quantitative analysis of importance of learned state estimations for humanoid locomotion
- Effective actor-critic framework to learn locomotion skills using key state estimations
- Demonstration of sim-to-real transfer of learned policy on real bipedal robot

The paper provides useful insights on designing state estimation mechanisms to improve learning-based control of complex legged robots. The framework and analysis methodology could guide future research in this area.
