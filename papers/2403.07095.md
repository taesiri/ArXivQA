# [Overcoming the Paradox of Certified Training with Gaussian Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07095)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training neural networks to be certifiably robust against adversarial examples while maintaining high standard accuracy remains an open challenge. 
- Prior work showed that tighter convex relaxations, which compute more precise bounds on the worst-case loss, paradoxically perform worse in training than looser relaxations. This is because tighter relaxations induce loss surfaces that are discontinuous and highly sensitive to perturbations.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper theoretically shows that Gaussian Loss Smoothing, where the loss is convolved with a Gaussian kernel, can alleviate both the discontinuity and perturbation sensitivity issues of tighter relaxations. This induces continuity and infinite differentiability.
- The paper proposes a novel certified training method combining Policy Gradients with Parameter-based Exploration (PGPE), which recovers Gaussian Loss Smoothing in expectation, with different convex relaxations.

Key Results:
- Empirically evaluating PGPE training shows that, unlike standard training, tighter bounds now lead to better networks - thereby confirming PGPE helps overcome issues with discontinuity and sensitivity.
- Combining PGPE with the DeepPoly relaxation outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the same networks by leveraging tight bounds while ensuring continuity via smoothing.
- While computationally expensive currently, results clearly demonstrate promise of Gaussian Loss Smoothing for certified training to overcome accuracy-robustness tradeoff.

Main Contributions:
- Theoretical analysis showing Gaussian Loss Smoothing addresses discontinuity and sensitivity of tight relaxations.
- Novel PGPE-based certified training method achieving DeepPoly tightness while ensuring continuity.  
- Large-scale evaluation confirming importance of continuity and sensitivity, and demonstrating potential of loss smoothing approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper shows theoretically and empirically that Gaussian loss smoothing can overcome the paradox of certified training by inducing continuity and smoothness, allowing tighter convex relaxations to achieve better certified robustness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Theoretically investigating the effect of Gaussian Loss Smoothing on the continuity and sensitivity of the approximate worst-case loss in certified training. Gaussian Loss Smoothing is shown to induce continuity and infinite differentiability, which helps overcome issues with discontinuities and high sensitivity that tighter relaxations suffer from.

2. Proposing a novel certified training method based on PGPE that recovers Gaussian Loss Smoothing in expectation. This allows training with tight bounds like DeepPoly while ensuring continuity.

3. Conducting a large-scale empirical evaluation of different convex relaxations under PGPE optimization. The results demonstrate the promise of Loss Smoothing approaches, as tighter bounds lead to better performance when combined with PGPE, overcoming the "paradox of certified training". While computationally expensive currently, the method with PGPE + DeepPoly bounds outperforms standard training and sometimes state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the main contribution is overcoming the paradox of certified training by showing both theoretically and empirically that tighter relaxations can outperform loose ones when continuity is ensured via Gaussian Loss Smoothing, pointing to a promising direction for developing better certified defenses.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

8. The computational cost of PGPE training, especially with precise bounds like DeepPoly, is identified as a key limitation. What concrete training times and computational resources were required for the experiments and what aspects drive cost?

9. What modifications to the PGPE algorithm could help improve the quality of gradient approximations to make training more efficient? What other approaches could help scale Gaussian loss smoothing?
