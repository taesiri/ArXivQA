# [EntGPT: Linking Generative Large Language Models with Knowledge Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06738)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 can hallucinate and generate incorrect or nonsensical text. This happens partly due to the lack of grounding of facts during pre-training and inference.
- Linking text to structured knowledge bases can help mitigate this issue. The paper explores this through the entity disambiguation (ED) task which links text mentions to entities in a knowledge base.

Proposed Solutions:
- EntGPT-Prompting (EntGPT-P): A 3-step prompting approach to emulate prompt tuning without supervision. It generates entity candidates, extracts auxiliary context for the mention using the LLM, and then prompts the LLM to select the right entity through multi-choice question.

- EntGPT-Instruction tuning (EntGPT-I): Additional instruction tuning of the LLM usingPrompt-Response pairs constructed from the AIDA dataset to improve ED performance.

Key Contributions:

- EntGPT-P achieves strong ED performance in zero-shot setting, comparable to supervised models in some cases. It substantially boosts the performance of base LLMs.

- EntGPT-I outperforms prior SOTA models on ED by 2.1% on average across datasets. It also achieves SOTA results on 6 question answering tasks in zero-shot setting, demonstrating the value of grounding for factual correctness.

- Detailed comparison of the methods on open-source (Llama2) and closed-source (GPT-3.5) LLMs show consistent improvements in ED micro-F1 scores over the base models.

- Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of each model component, especially the entity grounding which is directly responsible for performance gains.

In summary, the EntGPT framework with its prompting and instruction tuning variants enable grounding of LLMs to structured knowledge bases, helping mitigate hallucination issues and improving factual correctness. The methods are model-agnostic and achieve strong results on multiple language understanding tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes two methods, EntGPT-P and EntGPT-I, to link mentions in text to entities in a knowledge base in order to reduce hallucination and improve accuracy of large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The introduction of two methods to ground generative language models with knowledge bases for the entity disambiguation task: EntGPT-Prompting (EntGPT-P) and EntGPT-Instruction tuning (EntGPT-I). 

2) Demonstrating that both EntGPT-P and EntGPT-I achieve strong performance on multiple entity disambiguation benchmarks, with EntGPT-I achieving state-of-the-art results. Specifically, EntGPT-I obtains a 2.1% average micro-F1 score improvement compared to previous methods on 6 entity disambiguation datasets.

3) Showing that the knowledge-enhanced EntGPT-I model helps generative language models produce more factually correct answers on question answering tasks, attaining state-of-the-art accuracy on 6 QA datasets in a zero-shot setting.

4) An analysis of the various components of the EntGPT methods via ablation studies, indicating that entity candidate generation and auxiliary content augmentation both contribute substantially to performance.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting and evaluating two methods that effectively ground generative language models to knowledge bases for improved performance on entity disambiguation and question answering tasks.
