# [Generative Diffusions in Augmented Spaces: A Complete Recipe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01748)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that a complete recipe for constructing forward diffusion processes in score-based generative models can lead to improved sample quality and speed-quality tradeoffs. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a parameterization of the forward diffusion process that is guaranteed to converge to a desired simple distribution, and shows this recipe subsumes many existing diffusion models as special cases. Using this recipe, the paper introduces a novel diffusion model called Phase Space Langevin Diffusion (PSLD) which performs diffusion in an augmented space of data and momentum variables. 

The key hypothesis seems to be that diffusing in this joint phase space with properly tuned parameters will enable improved sample quality and faster sampling compared to existing diffusion models. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis by benchmarking PSLD against competitive baselines on image synthesis tasks. Overall, the goal is to provide a principled and generalizable framework for designing high-performance diffusion models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a general recipe/framework for constructing stochastic diffusion processes for score-based generative models (SGMs). The recipe provides a principled way to design new diffusion processes with guaranteed convergence to a desired target distribution, without needing domain-specific physical intuition. 

2. Using this recipe to construct a new SGM called Phase Space Langevin Diffusion (PSLD), which performs diffusion jointly in the data space and an auxiliary "momentum" space. PSLD generalizes previous models like Critically Damped Langevin Diffusion.

3. Demonstrating through experiments that PSLD achieves state-of-the-art sample quality on image synthesis benchmarks like CIFAR-10 and CelebA-64. It outperforms existing SGM baselines in terms of FID scores and speed-quality tradeoffs using different samplers.

4. Providing an analysis of how the noise parameters in PSLD impact sample quality, and identifying optimal settings. This gives guidance on how to design new diffusion processes using the proposed recipe.

5. Achieving an FID of 2.10 on CIFAR-10 unconditional image generation using PSLD, which is competitive with the current state-of-the-art in SGMs.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a general framework for designing new stochastic diffusion processes for SGMs, exemplifying this on a novel model called PSLD, and demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance on image synthesis tasks.
