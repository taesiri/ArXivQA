# [Generative Diffusions in Augmented Spaces: A Complete Recipe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01748)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that a complete recipe for constructing forward diffusion processes in score-based generative models can lead to improved sample quality and speed-quality tradeoffs. Specifically, the paper proposes a parameterization of the forward diffusion process that is guaranteed to converge to a desired simple distribution, and shows this recipe subsumes many existing diffusion models as special cases. Using this recipe, the paper introduces a novel diffusion model called Phase Space Langevin Diffusion (PSLD) which performs diffusion in an augmented space of data and momentum variables. The key hypothesis seems to be that diffusing in this joint phase space with properly tuned parameters will enable improved sample quality and faster sampling compared to existing diffusion models. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis by benchmarking PSLD against competitive baselines on image synthesis tasks. Overall, the goal is to provide a principled and generalizable framework for designing high-performance diffusion models.
