# [CDNet is all you need: Cascade DCN based underwater object detection   RCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12982)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be how to improve underwater object detection accuracy and speed using existing state-of-the-art object detection algorithms like Cascade R-CNN and Deformable Convolutional Networks. Specifically, the authors explore applying these algorithms to an underwater image dataset and evaluate their performance in terms of accuracy and speed. The main hypothesis appears to be that combining aspects of Cascade R-CNN and Deformable ConvNets into a unified model called CDNet will improve underwater object detection over using either method alone.
