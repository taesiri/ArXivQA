# [CDNet is all you need: Cascade DCN based underwater object detection   RCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12982)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be how to improve underwater object detection accuracy and speed using existing state-of-the-art object detection algorithms like Cascade R-CNN and Deformable Convolutional Networks. Specifically, the authors explore applying these algorithms to an underwater image dataset and evaluate their performance in terms of accuracy and speed. The main hypothesis appears to be that combining aspects of Cascade R-CNN and Deformable ConvNets into a unified model called CDNet will improve underwater object detection over using either method alone.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:- Proposing a new model called CDNet for underwater object detection, which combines Cascade R-CNN and Deformable Convolutional Networks (DCN). - Using ResNext101 as the backbone instead of ResNet50 for better feature extraction.- Adding Global Context Pooling (GCP) and Attention blocks to further enhance feature representations. - Applying data augmentation tricks like bounding box jittering to deal with labeling noise in the training data.- Achieving good detection performance on an underwater robotics dataset, ranking 18th out of over 500 teams. The model reaches a speed of 2.2 seconds per image and mAP of 0.567.- Providing ablation studies showing the improvements gained by each component (ResNext101, GCB, Attention, BBox Jittering etc).- Identifying challenges like small and overlapping objects that need to be addressed in future work to reach state-of-the-art performance.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the CDNet architecture for underwater detection and demonstrating its effectiveness on a competition benchmark dataset. The design choices and ablation studies provide useful insights as well.
