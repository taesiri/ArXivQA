# [Recursions Are All You Need: Towards Efficient Deep Unfolding Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05505)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to enhance the efficiency of deep unfolding networks for compressive sensing through the use of recursions. The key hypotheses are:1) Using recursions can effectively eliminate redundancies in deep unfolding networks, reducing the number of parameters and training time.2) Randomizing the number of recursions during training can further decrease training time. 3) Modulating features based on the number of recursions (using a learnable unit) allows the model to more efficiently utilize the power of recursions.The overall goal is to show that a recursion-based framework can improve the efficiency of deep unfolding models like ISTA-Net+ and COAST in terms of number of parameters, training time, and resilience to overfitting when training data is limited. The use of recursions is proposed as a way to achieve this increased efficiency while maintaining competitive performance.
