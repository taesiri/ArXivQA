# [Triad: A Framework Leveraging a Multi-Role LLM-based Agent to Solve   Knowledge Base Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14320)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge base question answering (KBQA) is challenging to implement using traditional methods due to the lack of task-specific training data and the complexity of creating specialized model architectures. 
- Recent progress with large language models (LLMs) as agents has shown promise, but their use in KBQA remains largely unexplored.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Triad, a unified framework that utilizes an LLM-based agent with three distinct roles to solve KBQA tasks. 
- The three roles are:
   - Agent as a generalist (G-Agent): Proficient at mastering various subtasks with few examples
   - Agent as a decision maker (D-Agent): Focuses on identifying options and selecting candidates
   - Agent as an advisor (A-Agent): Skilled at answering questions using internal and external knowledge
- The framework executes KBQA in four phases:
   1. Question parsing 
   2. URI linking
   3. Query construction
   4. Answer generation
- Each agent role handles different subtasks in these phases in collaboration.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to leverage an LLM-based agent to solve KBQA tasks in all four phases, without specialized training.
- Implementation of an LLM-based agent with supplemental task-specific modules that can act as three distinct roles.
- Evaluation showing the framework matches or exceeds state-of-the-art KBQA systems and pure LLM methods on three benchmarks.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel KBQA framework called Triad that employs a multi-role LLM-based agent. It demonstrates competitive performance to traditional systems without any task-specific training, highlighting the potential of LLM-based agents. The three collaborating roles and incorporation of external knowledge are key innovations of the framework.
