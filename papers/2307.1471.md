# [On Hofstadter's G-sequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.1471)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is characterizing the entries of Hofstadter's G-sequence in terms of the lower and upper Wythoff sequences. Specifically, the paper proves that:G(L(n))=n G(U(n))=L(n)Where G is Hofstadter's G-sequence, L is the lower Wythoff sequence, and U is the upper Wythoff sequence. This characterization is then used to give a short proof that Hofstadter's G-sequence is equal to the sequence of averages of the swapped Wythoff sequences.In summary, the main research goal is to provide new characterizations and properties of Hofstadter's G-sequence in terms of other well-known integer sequences, particularly the Wythoff sequences. This leads to new insights and simple proofs regarding Hofstadter's sequence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It provides a characterization of the entries of Hofstadter's G-sequence in terms of the lower and upper Wythoff sequences. - It uses this characterization to give a short proof that Hofstadter's G-sequence is equal to the sequence of averages of the swapped Wythoff sequences. - It generalizes some of the results to other quadratic algebraic numbers besides the golden ratio.In particular, Theorem 2 expresses the entries of the G-sequence G(n) in terms of the lower and upper Wythoff sequences L(n) and U(n). This leads to a short proof in Theorem 4 that the averaged swapped Wythoff sequence is equal to the G-sequence. The paper also explores some generalizations of these results to other quadratic irrationals like the silver ratio. It provides some analogous results relating the generalized G-sequence and Wythoff sequences in these cases.So in summary, the main contribution is connecting the G-sequence to the Wythoff sequences and using this connection to prove some existing conjectures and provide generalizations. The characterizations and connections between these sequences are the core results.
