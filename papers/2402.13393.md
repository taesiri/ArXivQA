# [Fairness Risks for Group-conditionally Missing Demographics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13393)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most existing fair machine learning models require full knowledge of sensitive demographic features like gender or race. However, in many real-world applications, these features may be unavailable or only partially available due to privacy concerns, legal issues, or individuals' reluctance to share such information. The key challenge addressed in this paper is that the unavailability of demographics can depend on the demographic group itself. For example, people of certain age groups may be more reluctant to reveal their age for certain applications like hiring. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a semi-supervised variational autoencoder model called Fair-SS-VAE to address the problem of group-conditionally missing demographics in fair classification. The key ideas are:

1) Model the group-conditional missing mechanism using a probabilistic model P(observed demo | true demo). Add constraints on this model to prevent solutions like swapping groups.

2) Design a differentiable fairness risk measure that handles probabilistic demographic imputations, allowing it to be integrated with general semi-supervised learners. Address potential issues like manipulating imputed demographics to reduce fairness risk.  

3) Instantiate the semi-supervised learner as a VAE, with separate encoder and decoder networks for class label and demographics. Allow conditioning missing data on observed values.

4) Estimate expectations in fairness risk using Monte Carlo sampling for efficiency. Provide analysis of sample complexity.

Main Contributions:

1) Novel formulation and model for fair classification with group-conditionally missing sensitive demographics.

2) Techniques to avoid pathological solutions when jointly learning representations and missing data in VAE framework.

3) Efficient Monte Carlo approach to compute expectations in fairness risk measures.

4) Empirical demonstration that the proposed Fair-SS-VAE model outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly in terms of fairness metrics on image and tabular datasets, while maintaining competitive accuracy.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions towards making fair ML models applicable to practical settings where sensitive demographic information can be partially missing in a group-dependent manner.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new fair classifier that can handle demographics being partially missing in a group-dependent way by modeling the missing data mechanism, incorporating probabilistic imputations into a differentiable fairness risk regularization, and integrating it with a semi-supervised variational autoencoder.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new fair classifier to address the problem of group-conditionally missing demographic information. Specifically:

1) The paper designs a differentiable fairness risk that can be customized for different fairness metrics and directly integrated into general semi-supervised learning algorithms. This allows enforcing fairness constraints even when the sensitive demographic features are only partially observed.

2) The paper presents a variational autoencoder model that can deal with group-conditionally missing demographic information, where the chance of a demographic being unavailable depends on the specific group. 

3) The paper provides an efficient way to evaluate and differentiate the proposed fairness risks using Monte Carlo sampling. This addresses the challenge that most fairness metrics do not factor over individual examples.

4) The paper demonstrates empirically that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fair classification tasks where both the demographic and label information are only partially available. Experiments are conducted on both image and tabular datasets.

In summary, the key innovation is in enabling fairness-aware classification with missing demographic information, while accounting for the real-world challenge that the missingness depends on the group. Both model design and inference techniques are tailored for this setting.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Fairness-aware classification
- Group fairness
- Missing sensitive features
- Group-conditionally missing demographics
- Semi-supervised learning
- Variational autoencoder (VAE)
- Probabilistic imputation
- Fairness risk
- Difference of equalized odds (DEO)

The paper proposes a new fairness-aware classifier that can handle group-conditionally missing demographic features. It leverages semi-supervised learning and a VAE model for probabilistic imputation of the missing sensitive features. The key ideas include formulating a differentiable fairness risk measure and integrating it into the VAE training objective to promote group fairness. Experiments on image and tabular datasets demonstrate improved fairness in terms of DEO while maintaining accuracy.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new fairness risk framework that handles group-conditionally missing demographics. How does explicitly modeling the missing data generation process allow them to account for issues like groups being more reluctant to provide demographic information?

2. The authors argue against simply promoting independence between predictions and demographics when demographics are missing. Why is directly optimizing for a specific fairness metric better than just encouraging independence? 

3. The paper introduces a new technique to stop gradients on the demographic inference model $q_\phi(A|X,\tilde{A})$. Why is this important and how does it prevent unintended consequences?

4. What are the key advantages of the proposed Monte Carlo approach to estimate the fairness risk? How does it allow efficient computation and differentiation? 

5. The new conditional VAE model introduces separate encoders for demographics and labels. What is the motivation behind this design choice compared to having a single encoder?

6. How does the straight-through Gumbel softmax estimator allow end-to-end differentiation of discrete samples from the VAE? What are its limitations?

7. Explain the issue with using the classification model $P_f(Y|X)$ itself to impute missing labels for fairness evaluation. How does using a separate model $P_g(Y|X)$ resolve this?

8. What modifications need to be made to apply the proposed method to settings with continuous demographics or multi-class labels? Would the results still hold?

9. The risk minimization formula for labeling test data relies on observed demographics. How can we extend it to the case of fully missing demographics?

10. The experimental results demonstrate strong gains over prior arts across multiple datasets. Can you think of datasets or problem settings where the proposed approach may struggle?
