# [Code-Switched Language Identification is Harder Than You Think](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01505)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Code-switching (CS), using multiple languages in one utterance, is very common but poorly handled by NLP systems. Identifying CS text is an important first step to improve NLP applications.  
- Prior CS language identification (LID) research is limited to only 2 languages and uses complex models that don't scale well. 
- The authors investigate CS LID to build CS text corpora from web-scale sources. This requires high-coverage LID that is fast and lightweight.

Methods:
- The task is defined as labelling sentences with language codes rather than word-level tagging.
- Three models are tested: OpenLID (adapted single-label model), MultiLID (novel multi-label model), and Franc (existing package).
- Models are evaluated on 6 CS test sets covering 8 languages plus a large single-language benchmark.
- Precision, recall and other standard metrics are found to be misleading for multi-label CS LID. More suitable metrics are proposed instead.

Results:
- No model achieves adequate performance, with very low exact match ratios on CS sentences.  
- OpenLID tends to predict only one language due to its single-label design. MultiLID predicts more labels but also more incorrect ones. Franc struggles with mixed-script CS.
- Analysis shows fundamental ambiguity in defining and labelling CS causes issues for the models.

Main Contributions:
- First exploration of practical large-scale CS LID for corpus building
- Novel multi-label CS LID model (MultiLID) 
- Thorough evaluation on diverse CS test sets covering 8 languages
- Highlights issues with using standard metrics for multi-label tasks
- Provides analysis and recommendations to guide future CS LID research
