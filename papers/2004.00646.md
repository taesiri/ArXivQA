## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this survey paper on conversational recommender systems to other related works:- Scope: This paper provides a broad overview of conversational recommender systems, covering key aspects like interaction modalities, knowledge sources, computational tasks, and evaluation. Many other survey papers focus only on a specific sub-area, such as critiquing-based systems or dialogue modeling. - Structure: The paper is well-structured and systematically covers the main building blocks of conversational recommenders. Other surveys tend to be more free-form in their structure. The conceptual architecture diagram provides a clear overview.- Technical depth: The authors provide a high-level technical discussion of approaches for the main computational tasks like recommendation, explanation, and dialogue management. Other surveys like Radlinski et al. (2019) go into more algorithmic depth.- Evaluation: A detailed analysis of evaluation methods and metrics is provided. Other surveys, e.g. by Zhang et al. (2018), provide less coverage of evaluation aspects.- Literature coverage: With 121 cited papers, this survey covers the literature comprehensively. Earlier works, e.g. by Bridge (2002), discuss a much smaller set of papers.- Recency: As a 2021 publication, this survey covers very recent advances in conversational recommenders based on deep learning and neural networks. Older surveys do not reflect these latest developments.In summary, this paper stands out through its broad scope, systematic structure, comprehensive coverage of the literature, and focus on recent advances. It provides an excellent reference point for researchers looking to get an overview of the field of conversational recommendation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions:1. Interaction modalities - More research is needed to understand which interaction modalities (voice, text, etc.) are best suited for different recommendation tasks and situations. There are also opportunities in interpreting non-verbal communication from users. 2. Application environments - Most existing research focuses on web/mobile applications. More work is needed to understand requirements and challenges when deploying conversational recommenders in non-standard environments like physical stores, cars, robots, etc.3. Conversation theories - Very little work so far draws on insights from fields like conversation analysis and communication theory. More research is needed to understand user expectations, requirements, adoption factors, and design effective communication strategies.4. Technical approaches - Pure end-to-end learning approaches have limitations. Combining learning with structured knowledge seems key for building more robust, usable, and predictable conversational recommenders. More research is also needed on evaluation methods beyond metrics like BLEU.In summary, the authors highlight the need for more interdisciplinary research to address interaction modalities, new applications, theoretical grounding, and technical methods for conversational recommenders. Key gaps exist around understanding user needs, evaluation, and combining learning with knowledge engineering.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper "A Survey on Conversational Recommender Systems":This survey paper provides an overview of conversational recommender systems, which are software systems that support multi-turn dialogues with users to help them find items of interest or make decisions. The authors review common building blocks of such systems, including interaction modalities (e.g. natural language, forms), underlying knowledge and data sources (e.g. item databases, dialogue corpora), and computational tasks (e.g. intent recognition, explanation generation). They also discuss evaluation approaches, finding that efficiency, conversation quality, and task support are common dimensions, measured through user studies and offline experiments.
