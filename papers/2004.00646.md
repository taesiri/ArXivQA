# A Survey on Conversational Recommender Systems

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question of this paper is: What are the main characteristics, approaches, and trends in the field of conversational recommender systems (CRS)? The paper provides a comprehensive literature review and conceptual discussion of CRS. The key aspects covered include:- Definition and conceptual architecture of CRS- Interaction modalities (input/output types, devices, interaction initiative)- Knowledge and data used in CRS (user intents, user modeling, dialogue states, corpora, etc.) - Computational tasks (requesting, recommending, explaining, responding)- Evaluation approaches (effectiveness, efficiency, conversation quality, subtask performance)So in summary, the paper aims to provide a structured overview and analysis of the main concepts, techniques, and evaluation practices related to conversational recommender systems based on a broad review of the literature. It does not test a specific hypothesis, but rather synthesizes and conceptualizes current research in this emerging field. The paper concludes by identifying open challenges and future research directions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is providing a comprehensive survey of the field of conversational recommender systems (CRS). The key aspects covered in the survey include:- Providing a definition and conceptual architecture for CRS. The paper defines a CRS as a software system that supports users in achieving recommendation-related goals through a multi-turn dialogue. A typical architecture consists of components for dialogue management, user modeling, recommendation, input/output processing etc.- Reviewing different interaction modalities for CRS such as natural language, voice, gestures, etc. as well as application environments like chatbots, virtual assistants, and interactive stores. - Analyzing the knowledge components and data sources leveraged in CRS, including item databases, dialogue corpora, world knowledge, etc.- Discussing the main computational tasks involved in CRS such as determining next questions, generating recommendations, providing explanations, and responding appropriately. Various techniques like reinforcement learning, bandits, etc. are reviewed.- Providing an analysis of evaluation approaches, metrics, and methods used for CRS across dimensions like task effectiveness, efficiency, conversation quality, etc.- Identifying research gaps and providing an outlook on future directions for conversational recommendation research.In summary, the paper provides a structured analysis of the landscape of conversational recommender systems based on a broad review of existing literature. The comprehensive coverage of concepts, techniques, and evaluations helps create a solid foundation to understand progress in this field.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?
