## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions:

1. Interaction modalities - More research is needed to understand which interaction modalities (voice, text, etc.) are best suited for different recommendation tasks and situations. There are also opportunities in interpreting non-verbal communication from users. 

2. Application environments - Most existing research focuses on web/mobile applications. More work is needed to understand requirements and challenges when deploying conversational recommenders in non-standard environments like physical stores, cars, robots, etc.

3. Conversation theories - Very little work so far draws on insights from fields like conversation analysis and communication theory. More research is needed to understand user expectations, requirements, adoption factors, and design effective communication strategies.

4. Technical approaches - Pure end-to-end learning approaches have limitations. Combining learning with structured knowledge seems key for building more robust, usable, and predictable conversational recommenders. More research is also needed on evaluation methods beyond metrics like BLEU.

In summary, the authors highlight the need for more interdisciplinary research to address interaction modalities, new applications, theoretical grounding, and technical methods for conversational recommenders. Key gaps exist around understanding user needs, evaluation, and combining learning with knowledge engineering.
