# [The Missing Piece in Model Editing: A Deep Dive into the Hidden Damage   Brought By Model Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07825)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, but often contain outdated or erroneous information. Editing LLMs to update knowledge is crucial but can lead to unintended "ripple effects".
- One understudied ripple effect is in the hidden space, where editing one fact unintentionally affects unrelated facts about other entities. This occurs due to similarity of entities in the latent space.  
- This "ripple effect in hidden space" is difficult to detect but can significantly deteriorate model performance as more edits are made.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new evaluation methodology called Graphical Outlier Relation-based Assessment (GORA) to quantitatively assess model adaptations and ripple effect impact from editing.
- GORA constructs connections between related entities based on the model's knowledge graph to identify hidden relationships. Evaluating model performance on edited and related triplets reveals the ripple effect's extent.
- They also propose a Selective Outlier Re-Editing Approach (SORA) to mitigate the ripple effect. By identifying key related triplets and editing those as well, SORA reduces unintended side effects.

Main Contributions:
- First work exploring the detrimental but implicit "ripple effect in hidden space" phenomenon in model editing.
- Introduction of GORA, a specialized technique to evaluate this ripple effect during model editing.  
- Development of SORA, an innovative editing method using knowledge graphs to alleviate the ripple effect.
- Comprehensive analysis showing GORA effectively identifies and SORA successfully mitigates the ripple effect better than other techniques.
- Discovery that ripple effect in hidden space causes greater disruption than other variants and exists in all current editing methods.

In summary, this paper makes important progress in detecting and overcoming a significant but overlooked challenge in editing large language models - the ripple effect in the hidden space. The proposed GORA evaluation and SORA editing methods are shown to be effective solutions.
