# [The Missing Piece in Model Editing: A Deep Dive into the Hidden Damage   Brought By Model Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07825)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, but often contain outdated or erroneous information. Editing LLMs to update knowledge is crucial but can lead to unintended "ripple effects".
- One understudied ripple effect is in the hidden space, where editing one fact unintentionally affects unrelated facts about other entities. This occurs due to similarity of entities in the latent space.  
- This "ripple effect in hidden space" is difficult to detect but can significantly deteriorate model performance as more edits are made.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new evaluation methodology called Graphical Outlier Relation-based Assessment (GORA) to quantitatively assess model adaptations and ripple effect impact from editing.
- GORA constructs connections between related entities based on the model's knowledge graph to identify hidden relationships. Evaluating model performance on edited and related triplets reveals the ripple effect's extent.
- They also propose a Selective Outlier Re-Editing Approach (SORA) to mitigate the ripple effect. By identifying key related triplets and editing those as well, SORA reduces unintended side effects.

Main Contributions:
- First work exploring the detrimental but implicit "ripple effect in hidden space" phenomenon in model editing.
- Introduction of GORA, a specialized technique to evaluate this ripple effect during model editing.  
- Development of SORA, an innovative editing method using knowledge graphs to alleviate the ripple effect.
- Comprehensive analysis showing GORA effectively identifies and SORA successfully mitigates the ripple effect better than other techniques.
- Discovery that ripple effect in hidden space causes greater disruption than other variants and exists in all current editing methods.

In summary, this paper makes important progress in detecting and overcoming a significant but overlooked challenge in editing large language models - the ripple effect in the hidden space. The proposed GORA evaluation and SORA editing methods are shown to be effective solutions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a graphical outlier relation based evaluation method and a selective outlier re-editing approach to identify and mitigate the implicit ripple effect in the hidden space during large language model editing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a novel evaluation methodology called Graphical Outlier Relation based Assessment (GORA) to effectively identify the "ripple effect in hidden space" during model editing. This effect refers to unexpected changes in different, unrelated facts and entities due to edits made to the model. 

2. Developing a new model editing method called Selective Outlier Re-Editing Approach (SORA) that leverages the design of GORA to mitigate the ripple effect in hidden space. SORA identifies and re-edits key outliers related to the edited entities to reduce unwanted side effects.

3. Comprehensively evaluating both GORA and SORA through experiments. The results demonstrate that GORA can effectively discern the ripple effect in hidden space, which is shown to be present in all current model editing methods. Meanwhile, SORA is shown to effectively alleviate this issue compared to other techniques.

In summary, the main contributions are proposing innovative evaluation and editing techniques to address the significant but overlooked challenge of the ripple effect in hidden space during model editing. Both GORA and SORA show strong performance in identifying and mitigating this effect respectively.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel evaluation methodology called Graphical Outlier Relation based Assessment (GORA). Can you explain in detail how GORA works and how it identifies the ripple effect in the hidden space during model editing?

2. One key aspect of GORA is that it builds connections between related entities in the hidden space based on the model to be edited and a given knowledge graph. Can you walk through how these connections are established and why this graph differs from the vanilla knowledge graph? 

3. The paper argues that GORA provides a better representation and more effectively highlights the "ripple effect in hidden space" compared to the vanilla knowledge graph. What evidence does it provide to support this claim? Can you analyze the differences between the degree distributions?

4. The proposed Selective Outlier Re-Editing Approach (SORA) aims to mitigate the ripple effect in the hidden space. Walk through the technical details of how SORA identifies and re-edits outliers. What are the caveats associated with excessive re-editing?

5. The experiments compare multiple model editing techniques such as Fine-Tuning, Constrained Fine-Tuning, MEND, ROME, MEMIT and ICE. Can you critically analyze the limitations of these methods in dealing with the ripple effect in hidden space?  

6. Table 3 shows detailed experimental results on perplexity changes using the vanilla knowledge graph and GORA. Analyze these results to explain why GORA is effective in identifying the ripple effect in hidden space.

7. Graph edit distance is used to quantify the differences between the vanilla knowledge graph and GORA graph. Explain how this metric is calculated and analyze the results shown in Figure 2.

8. Figure 4 shows SORA’s ability to decrease overall perplexity and outliers’ perplexity. Interpret these results and discuss the tradeoffs associated with the number of re-edits. 

9. The case studies in Tables 4 and 5 showcase how methods like MEMIT, ICE and SORA perform on sample model outputs before and after editing. Compare and critique these qualitative results.

10. While the proposed methods in this paper are promising, they have limitations regarding efficiency, dependence on knowledge graphs and model selection. Discuss each of these limitations and potential ways to address them.
