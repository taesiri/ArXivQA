# [Robustifying and Boosting Training-Free Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07591)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Neural architecture search (NAS) aims to automate neural network design, but training-based NAS methods are computationally expensive. 
- Recently proposed training-free NAS methods estimate performance using metrics computed without training, but no single metric works well across diverse tasks.
- There is an estimation gap between training-free metrics and true performance that limits finding optimal architectures.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a new NAS algorithm called RoBoT that:
   1) Robustifies training-free metrics by optimally combining them into a single robust metric using Bayesian Optimization. This ensures consistent performance across tasks.
   2) Quantifies the estimation gap using a new metric called Precision@T. 
   3) Boosts performance by exploiting the robust metric using greedy search to bridge the estimation gap.

Main Contributions:  
- First algorithm to provide theoretical guarantee on the expected performance of NAS using training-free metrics under mild assumptions. Performance depends on the robustness and estimation gap of the metrics.
- Empirically demonstrates state-of-the-art or competitive performance across 20 NAS benchmark tasks. Outperforms best single training-free metric, showing ability to boost their performance.
- Provides valuable insights, backed by ablation studies, into factors influencing performance - ensemble method, search budget split between exploration and exploitation phases, number of metrics combined.

Overall, the paper makes significant theoretical and empirical contributions towards making training-free NAS more robust and effective across diverse tasks. The proposed RoBoT algorithm and analyses open up new research directions into combining training-free metrics in NAS.
