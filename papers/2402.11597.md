# [Multi-Task Inference: Can Large Language Models Follow Multiple   Instructions at Once?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11597)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are typically only prompted to follow a single instruction per inference call. It is unclear if LLMs can also handle multiple instructions simultaneously, which the authors refer to as Multi-Task Inference (MTI).  
- There is a lack of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks to assess the MTI capabilities of LLMs across diverse tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce the MTI Bench, a new benchmark consisting of 5,000 instances across 25 tasks. Each task has 2-3 sub-tasks.
- The benchmark is divided into a Multi-Step subset (tasks with sequential dependency) and a Multi-Part subset (independent tasks).
- They compare MTI against Single-Task Inference (doing tasks sequentially) and Batch Prompting (batching instances of the same task).

Key Findings:
- Surprisingly, larger LLMs like Llama-70B and GPT-4 perform up to 7.3% and 12.4% better on MTI compared to Single-Task Inference.
- MTI provides a 1.46x speedup over Single-Task Inference by reducing the number of inference calls.
- Analyses suggest MTI allows models to leverage clues from later sub-tasks to improve performance on earlier sub-tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of MTI Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the MTI capabilities of LLMs.
- Demonstration that MTI can improve performance and reduce inference time compared to conventional prompting.
- Analysis providing insights into why MTI works better than expected for large LLMs.

In summary, the paper shows that large LLMs exhibit an emergent capability to handle multiple instructions simultaneously using the new MTI evaluation benchmark. This highlights opportunities to improve prompting schemes to better leverage model capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new benchmark called the Multi-Task Inference (MTI) Bench to evaluate whether large language models can handle multiple instructions simultaneously in one inference call, finding that models like Llama-2-Chat-70B and GPT-4 surprisingly perform better on multi-task inference compared to single-task inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors develop the \textsc{MTI Bench} (\textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{T}ask \textbf{I}nference \textbf{Bench}mark), a comprehensive benchmark with 5,000 instances across 25 tasks to evaluate the capability of large language models to handle multiple instructions simultaneously (multi-task inference).

2. Through experiments on 11 language models, they find that state-of-the-art models like \textsc{Llama-2-Chat-70B} and \textsc{GPT-4} surprisingly show better performance on multi-task inference compared to single-task inference. 

3. They demonstrate that multi-task inference provides a 1.46x speedup compared to single-task inference. This suggests that practitioners can leverage the capability of language models to solve multiple tasks concurrently to reduce inference time.

4. Through ablation studies and analysis, they suggest that the performance gains of multi-task inference arise from the language models' ability to leverage information from later sub-tasks to better solve earlier sub-tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and analysis of multi-task inference as an effective prompting strategy for large language models to handle instructions with multiple sub-tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, here are some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper:

- Multi-Task Inference
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Multi-processing capabilities
- MTI Bench benchmark
- Multi-Step subset
- Multi-Part subset  
- Single-Task Inference
- Batch Prompting
- Inference latency
- Free-Form Generation subset
- Look-ahead effect
- Emergent property
- Intermediate performance
- Final performance

The paper introduces the concept of Multi-Task Inference to evaluate the capability of large language models to process multiple instructions simultaneously in a single inference call. It constructs a new benchmark called MTI Bench with two subsets - Multi-Step and Multi-Part. Experiments compare Multi-Task Inference with Single-Task Inference and Batch Prompting. Key findings show Multi-Task Inference improves performance of larger models like GPT-4 and is faster. The analysis suggests a look-ahead effect enables models to leverage clues from later instructions to improve on initial tasks. The capability to handle concurrent tasks is indicated as an emergent property tied to model scale.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new benchmark called the MTI Bench to evaluate the capability of large language models to handle multiple instructions simultaneously. What are some key considerations in designing a comprehensive and unbiased benchmark to measure this capability?

2. The paper compares multi-task inference against single-task inference and batch prompting. What are the relative pros and cons of each method? Under what situations might one method be preferred over the others? 

3. The paper finds that multi-task inference leads to better performance for larger models on the proposed benchmark. What factors might explain why this emergent capability manifests in larger models but not smaller ones? 

4. The Multi-Step and Multi-Part subsets of the MTI Bench seem to test related but distinct capabilities. What underlying differences in the language models lead to varying performance on these two subsets?

5. The paper introduces a Free-Form Generation subset and finds smaller performance gaps between multi-task and single-task inference. Why might this be the case? What modifications could make multi-task inference more effective for free-form generation?

6. The analysis identifies patterns like "No Outputs" and "Referencing" that may explain the performance gains of multi-task inference. Are there other explanatory patterns that could emerge from a more in-depth analysis? 

7. The paper focuses on accuracy and inference speed. What other evaluation metrics could reveal additional insights into multi-task versus single-task inference?

8. How sensitive are the performance differences between inference methods to changes in prompt design, few-shot examples, hyperparameters, etc? What scheme could make evaluations more robust?

9. The paper studies a limited set of existing NLP benchmarks adapted for multi-task inference. What impact would purpose-built datasets have on measuring multi-task inference capabilities?

10. The evaluation is currently confined to English language tasks. How would multilingual and cross-lingual datasets need to be designed to effectively benchmark multi-task inference?
