# [KARL: Knowledge-Aware Retrieval and Representations aid Retention and   Learning in Students](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12291)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Existing flashcard scheduling systems rely solely on flashcard-level features like past responses to model students, failing to capture semantic relationships between flashcards. This limits their ability to make accurate predictions, especially on unseen cards. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) models address this via neural representations, but have not been deployed for real-world scheduling due to efficiency, evaluation, and teaching policy issues.

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes KARL, a DKT-inspired student model for flashcard scheduling. KARL uses a BERT retriever to efficiently find the top semantically similar flashcards in the student's history to a new card. These retrieved cards and the new card are fed along with flashcard metrics into a classifier to predict if the student will recall the new card. 

Main Contributions:
1) Design of KARL, the first retrieval-enhanced DKT model, improving efficiency and accounting for shifts in a student's study.
2) Collection and release of a diverse flashcard dataset with 123k study logs over 11 subjects to evaluate content-aware modeling.
3) Proposal of a novel delta teaching policy compatible with any DKT model to fully exploit predictive capabilities for scheduling.
4) Extensive offline evaluation showing KARL makes the most accurate and calibrated predictions of student recall. 
5) Online user study revealing KARL enhances medium-term retention similarly to state-of-the-art scheduler FSRS, proving its efficacy.

Overall, the paper presents KARL, a content-aware DKT scheduler using retrieval and BERT that robustly predicts student knowledge. Through offline and online experiments, the paper demonstrates the advantages of semantic modeling and motivates future scheduler research in this direction.
