# [Salience DETR: Enhancing Detection Transformer with Hierarchical   Salience Filtering Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16131)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing DETR-like detectors suffer from two types of redundancy - encoding redundancy where background queries introduce irrelevant information, and selection redundancy where two-stage query selection results in mismatch with actual objects. This leads to heavy computation burden and suboptimal performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a detector called Salience DETR with hierarchical salience filtering refinement to address the redundancies. Key ideas:
  - Introduce scale-independent salience supervision to guide query filtering and overcome scale bias
  - Hierarchical filtering to selectively encode queries based on salience - both across layers and levels 
  - Refinement modules to align semantics of encoded and non-encoded queries

Main Contributions:
- Scale-independent salience supervision that determines query importance based on distance to object center rather than scale, preventing bias
- Hierarchical filtering across layers and levels based on salience to selectively encode queries
- Refinement modules like background embedding, cross-level fusion and redundancy removal to align semantics

Results:
- Outperforms state-of-the-art on 3 task-specific datasets and COCO 2017
- Achieves 49.2 AP on COCO with 70% less FLOPs than DINO
- Ablations validate contributions of scale-independent supervision, hierarchical filtering and refinement modules

In summary, the paper identifies and addresses redundancies in two-stage DETR detectors through selective encoding guided by scale-independent salience and query refinement, achieving SOTA performance with lower computation. The core ideas of hierarchical filtering and scale-independent guidance can help advance transformer-based detection.
