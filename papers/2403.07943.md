# [Revisiting Edge Perturbation for Graph Neural Network in Graph Data   Augmentation and Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07943)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper focuses on two types of edge perturbation methods for graph neural networks (GNNs) - graph data augmentation (Gaug) and graph attack (Gatk). These two methods have the same operations (adding/removing edges) but opposite effects on GNN accuracy. Gaug improves accuracy while Gatk reduces it. The paper raises two open questions: (1) Why does edge perturbation have this two-faced effect? (2) What makes edge perturbation flexible and effective?

Proposed Solution:
The paper provides both theoretical and practical solutions to unify these two types of methods and establish a boundary between them. 

Theoretically, the paper casts both Gaug and Gatk workflows as an optimization problem with two independent constraint conditions. This shows they are essentially the same technique with different restrictions.

Practically, the paper proposes an Edge Priority Detector (EPD) module to generate a perturbation priority metric for edges. This priority can then be used to flexibly enable either augmentation or attack. EPD offers two solutions - directly computing priority from the graph or using target-guided modifications before computing priority.

Main Contributions:

- First work to systematically compare Gaug and Gatk methods and show their similarities and differences

- Unified formulation to cast Gaug and Gatk workflows as one optimization problem with different constraints  

- Edge Priority Detector (EPD) module to bridge Gaug and Gatk methods practically by offering a flexible way to do augmentation/attack

- Experiments showing EPD achieves better or comparable performance to other methods, with lower overhead

- Analysis revealing correlations between edge perturbation effectiveness and graph attributes

In summary, the key novelty is in unifying these two types of methods theoretically and providing a practical solution for flexible augmentation/attack with quantifiable edge priorities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes unifying graph neural network augmentation and attack methods by formulating them as optimization problems with different constraints, and introduces an Edge Priority Detector module to enable flexible data augmentation or attack by generating edge perturbation priorities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It presents the first work that systematically compares two categories of edge perturbation methods with opposite effects, i.e. graph data augmentation (Gaug) and graph attack (Gatk) methods, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. 

2. It theoretically unifies Gaug and Gatk methods by proving they share the same underlying technique and can be formulated as one optimization problem, differing only in their constraint conditions.

3. It proposes the Edge Priority Detector (EPD) module to enable flexible graph augmentation or attack. EPD bridges Gaug and Gatk methods in their workflows. Experiments show EPD can achieve comparable or better performance for augmentation/attack with less time overhead. 

4. EPD contributes a unified workflow and metric for tailored adjustment when making augmentations or attacks on graphs. This is said to inspire further research into devising new methods in this domain.

5. Experiments reveal correlations between the effectiveness of edge perturbation methods and intrinsic graph attributes, aimed at contributing to the advancement of edge perturbation techniques.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a unified formulation to cast augmentation and attack methods as one optimization problem with different constraints. What is the justification behind using this formulation, and what advantages does it provide over treating them as separate techniques?

2. The paper introduces the concept of an "edge priority detector" (EPD) to bridge augmentation and attack methods operationally. What specific graph properties does EPD leverage to calculate edge priorities for perturbation?

3. How does the target-guided modification approach used in the EPD's second solution differ from naive random modifications of the graph? What benefits does it provide in generating effective perturbations? 

4. The experiments compare accuracy and time costs across different perturbation methods. Does EPD achieve consistent improvements in both dimensions across all datasets tested? If not, what factors may cause variability?

5. For the augmentation case, the paper finds deep GNNs can outperform shallow GNNs when EPD is applied. Why does this differ from typical observations around deep GNN performance, and what implications does this have?

6. Why does the paper argue that the accuracy of GNNs will eventually decline if the edge perturbation ratio is increased continuously past a certain threshold in both augmentation and attack cases?  

7. The analysis of how different edge perturbation methods impact graph attributes provides useful insights. Are there any particularly surprising or counter-intuitive findings from this analysis? Why?

8. Could the proposed EPD technique be extended to other domains like dynamic graphs or heterogeneous graphs? What adaptations would need to be made?

9. The paper focuses on node classification tasks. How well would EPD transfer to edge- and graph-level prediction tasks? What new challenges might arise?

10. What are some promising future research directions that build upon the ideas introduced around unifying and flexibly controlling edge perturbations for augmentation versus attacks?
