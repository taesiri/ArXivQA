# [SCoDA: Domain Adaptive Shape Completion for Real Scans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10179)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we effectively transfer knowledge from synthetic 3D shapes to improve shape completion and reconstruction from real-world scans?The key challenges are:1) There is a domain gap between synthetic 3D shapes (e.g. from CAD models) and real-world scans. Real scans tend to be more sparse, noisy, and incomplete. 2) There is a lack of paired real scans and ground truth 3D shapes for supervision. Synthetic data has rich ground truth shapes, but does not match the characteristics of real scans.To address these challenges, the paper proposes a new task called SCoDA (Domain Adaptive Shape Completion) to transfer knowledge from synthetic data to real scan completion. The main contributions are:1) A new dataset called ScanSalon with 800 hand-created 3D shapes paired with real scans across 6 categories. This provides ground truth for real scans.2) A method using cross-domain feature fusion to combine global shape knowledge from synthetic data with local pattern knowledge from real data.3) A volume-consistency self-training approach to make the model robust to incomplete real scans.In summary, the key hypothesis is that combining global synthetic shape knowledge with local real scan knowledge can enable effective domain adaptation for scan completion. The paper aims to demonstrate this via the proposed SCoDA task, ScanSalon dataset, and cross-domain learning method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a new task called SCoDA (Domain Adaptive Shape Completion) for transferring knowledge from synthetic 3D shape data to real-world scan completion. This is motivated by the lack of complete ground truth shapes for real scan data.2. Introducing a new dataset called ScanSalon with 800 manually created 3D models paired with real scans across 6 object categories. The models serve as ground truth for a subset of the scans to enable training and evaluation.3. Presenting a method for SCoDA that uses a cross-domain feature fusion (CDFF) module to combine global shape knowledge from synthetic data with local pattern knowledge from real data when training an implicit shape reconstruction network. 4. Proposing a volume-consistent self-training (VCST) method to improve reconstruction robustness to incomplete real scans during training. This is done by enforcing prediction consistency between two augmented views of the scan.5. Providing extensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed SCoDA method compared to other baselines, and ablations analyzing the individual contributions of the CDFF and VCST components.In summary, the key contribution appears to be proposing the new SCoDA task and ScanSalon dataset to enable research on transferring synthetic 3D shape knowledge to real scan completion, along with a method combining cross-domain feature fusion and self-training to effectively address this challenge.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new task called SCoDA for domain adaptive shape completion of real scans, where knowledge from synthetic data is transferred to improve completion of sparse and incomplete real scans, and contributes a dataset ScanSalon with elaborately created 3D models paired with real scans to enable research in this direction.
