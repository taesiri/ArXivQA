# [A ripple in time: a discontinuity in American history](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01185)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper analyzes State of the Union (SOTU) addresses from US presidents using natural language processing techniques to uncover insights. Specifically, the authors look to see if there are temporal patterns or clustering in the speeches over time.

Methods
- The authors use pre-trained BERT (DistilBERT) and GPT-2 models to embed the SOTU texts into vector representations. 
- They apply nonlinear dimension reduction techniques like UMAP, TriMAP, and PaCMAP on the embeddings to visualize and cluster the speeches.
- They also fine-tune a DistilBERT classifier to predict authorship (which president gave each speech).

Key Findings
- As expected, speeches by the same president cluster together, as do speeches closer in time. 
- Surprisingly, there is a discontinuity around 1920s-1930s - speeches before and after this period form separate clusters.
- GPT-2 + UMAP gives the best temporal clustering. DistilBERT + TriMAP also works well. 
- The fine-tuned DistilBERT classifier can predict authorship with 93-95% accuracy.

Possible Explanations
- Pre-FDR presidents rarely used speechwriters unlike FDR onwards. This could explain the textual shift.
- USA's global role changed significantly post WWII, altering presidential focus.

In summary, the key contribution is finding the distinct shift in textual style of SOTU speeches in the 1920s-1930s period that likely reflects deeper political and economic changes in the US. The methods can further be used to analyze other textual corpora.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper uses text embeddings from BERT and GPT-2 models along with nonlinear dimension reduction techniques to analyze State of the Union addresses, revealing a discontinuity in language use around the late 1920s indicative of broader historical changes in American political rhetoric.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Using vector embeddings from BERT and GPT-2 models to analyze State of the Union addresses over time. The authors find that there is a clear separation/discontinuity in the speeches around 1920-1930, indicating some kind of shift in language use, focus, etc.

2) Comparing different nonlinear dimension reduction techniques (UMAP, TriMAP, PaCMAP) applied to the embeddings, and finding that GPT-2 + UMAP provides the best temporal clustering of the speeches.

3) Demonstrating that while BERT is widely used for NLP classification tasks, GPT-2 can also produce very good embeddings for clustering when combined with dimension reduction like UMAP.

4) Fine-tuning a DistilBERT model to perform authorship attribution on the speeches, identifying which president gave a particular speech. They achieve 93-95% accuracy on this task.

So in summary, the main contributions are using neural embeddings and dimension reduction for analysis and clustering of political speeches over time, comparison of techniques, and demonstration of an attribution task. The discovery of the historical discontinuity is also an interesting finding enabled by these methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with it include:

- Text embedding
- BERT
- GPT-2
- Dimension reduction 
- Clustering
- UMAP
- TriMAP
- PaCMAP
- FAISS
- Authorship attribution 
- Model fine-tuning

The paper utilizes text embedding techniques like BERT and GPT-2 to embed State of the Union addresses into vectors. It then applies dimension reduction methods like UMAP, TriMAP, and PaCMAP to visualize and cluster the embeddings. The goal is to observe temporal patterns and clustering in the addresses. The paper also experiments with fine-tuning a DistilBERT model to perform authorship attribution of the addresses. So keywords like text embedding, BERT, GPT-2, dimension reduction, clustering, authorship attribution, and model fine-tuning cover the main techniques and goals of the paper. The specific methods used like UMAP, TriMAP, and PaCMAP are also relevant keywords.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using both BERT and GPT-2 for generating embeddings of the SOTU speeches. What are the key differences between these two models and why might GPT-2 capture more granular details as the authors speculate? 

2. The paper applied nonlinear dimension reduction techniques like UMAP, TriMAP, and PaCMAP on top of the BERT and GPT-2 embeddings before visualizing. What is the motivation behind using nonlinear techniques compared to something basic like PCA? How do the different techniques compared?

3. The visualizations reveal an interesting temporal splitting of the speeches around the late 1920s. What are some potential underlying reasons for this dramatic shift that the authors propose? Can you think of any other historical or political factors around that time that could have contributed?

4. For the authorship attribution task, chunking the speeches and aggregating predictions seemed to significantly boost performance. Why do you think this is the case? What are the limitations of only looking at short chunks of text versus the whole document?  

5. The fine-tuned DistilBERT model reached 93-95% accuracy on authorship attribution. What techniques could be used to further improve this? How would you handle the class imbalance problem for presidents with very few speeches?

6. The paper mentions that wrong authorship predictions tend to be for temporally adjacent presidents. Does this suggest the language itself is evolving more gradually over time versus abrupt shifts between presidents? How could this be further analyzed?

7. What other NLP analyses could be run on a corpus like this to extract more insights? For example, analyzing sentiment, key topics over time, rhetorical devices, etc. What challenges might come up?

8. How well do you think these methods would transfer to other large political speech datasets like debates, UN addresses, congressional records, etc? What domain adaptation might need to be done?

9. What are some key limitations or critiques you might have about the methodology or analyses done in the paper? What could have been done differently or in addition?

10. The analyses rely solely on the text of the speeches. How could accompanying metadata like video, audio, approvals ratings, etc supplement the techniques used? What other multimodal analyses would be enabled with such data?
