# The Impact of Symbolic Representations on In-context Learning for   Few-shot Reasoning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How do natural language explanations compare to symbolic provenance when used as prompts for reasoning by language models?The authors aim to compare natural language and symbolic paradigms closely to gain insight into in-context learning for reasoning tasks. They propose using Language Models as Logic Programmers (LMLP) that learn from demonstrations containing logic rules and examples to iteratively reason over knowledge bases. The goal is to understand the role of symbolic representations for few-shot reasoning using in-context learning.In summary, the key research question is focused on comparing natural vs symbolic representations as prompts for in-context learning and reasoning by language models. The authors evaluate this through controlled experiments on relational reasoning using the LMLP method versus chain-of-thought prompting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. The paper proposes a new method called Language Models as Logic Programmers (LMLP) that enables few-shot learning for reasoning over knowledge bases. LMLP uses logic rule templates and examples to guide an autoregressive language model like GPT-2 to iteratively generate reasoning paths that explain the queries. 2. The paper systematically compares LMLP to chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, a popular in-context learning technique, on deductive reasoning tasks using synthetic datasets with natural language and symbolic logic pairs.3. Extensive experiments show LMLP attains over 25% higher accuracy than CoT on length generalization benchmarks, even with fewer parameters. The results provide insights into the strengths of symbolic representations and separating logic and control for in-context learning and reasoning.4. The work introduces a novel way to leverage pre-trained language models for neuro-symbolic reasoning in a sample-efficient manner, without expensive retraining or annotations. The method recovers symbolic algorithms like backward chaining within large neural models.5. The controlled study reveals that while pretrained LMs struggle with relational reasoning without proper input-label mappings, in-context learning can effectively adapt them for formal reasoning when given informative demonstrations.In summary, the key contribution is proposing LMLP to investigate the role of symbolic representations and logic-control separation for in-context learning, and demonstrating its strengths over chained reasoning for deductive tasks. The work provides useful insights into adapting large pretrained LMs for compositional reasoning in a neuro-symbolic framework.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Unfortunately I cannot provide a full summary of the paper as it appears quite technical and detailed. However, based on skimming the contents, it seems the paper is comparing different techniques for enabling language models to perform logical reasoning and deduction. The main points appear to be:- The authors propose a method called "Language Models as Logic Programmers" (LMLP) which uses logic rules and examples to teach language models to iteratively reason over knowledge bases. - LMLP is compared against the "chain of thought" prompting approach where language models are given examples with explanations. - Experiments show LMLP outperforms chain of thought prompting, especially on longer reasoning tasks, likely because it separates the logical rules from the language generation.- The results suggest in-context learning can enable language models to do some symbolic reasoning, but they struggle without proper demonstrations showing how to map inputs to outputs.In one sentence, the key point seems to be that symbolic logic rules and examples are more effective than natural language explanations for teaching language models to logically reason over knowledge bases.
