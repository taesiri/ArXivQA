# [EventGround: Narrative Reasoning by Grounding to Eventuality-centric   Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00209)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Narrative reasoning relies on understanding events in context, which requires background world knowledge. 
- Existing solutions model this knowledge in two paradigms: 
  1) Knowledge model paradigm: Implicitly model event knowledge by pretraining language models (LMs) with event objectives. However, this breaks down knowledge structures and lacks interpretability.
  2) Retrieval-and-integration paradigm: Explicitly collect world knowledge of events into structured eventuality-centric knowledge graphs (KGs). However, research on leveraging these KGs for free texts is limited.

Proposed Solution - EventGround:
- Proposes a framework to tackle the problem of grounding free texts to eventuality-centric KGs for contextualized narrative reasoning.

- Identifies two critical challenges:
  1) Event representation problem: Events are entangled in texts and lose co-reference information when extracted.
  2) Event sparsity problem: Natural language events are sparse, making matching to incomplete KGs difficult.

- Solutions:
  1) Event extraction + normalization to extract events while preserving co-references.
  2) Partial information extraction to create event abstractions and alleviate sparsity.

- Matches abstracted events to KG to find anchor events. Retrieves related subgraphs. 

- Employs GNN or LLM on joint graph for reasoning.

Main Contributions:  
1) Initial formulation for grounding free texts to eventuality-centric KGs.

2) Systematic EventGround framework to solve event representation & sparsity problems and perform reasoning.  

3) Achieves SOTA results on 3 tasks while providing interpretable evidence.
