# [SARDet-100K: Towards Open-Source Benchmark and ToolKit for Large-Scale   SAR Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06534)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- SAR object detection is vital for applications like defense and disaster relief, but suffers from limited public datasets (small-scale, mono-category objects) and inaccessible source code. 
- Significant domain gap between models pretrained on RGB images (e.g. ImageNet) vs fine-tuned on SAR images, as well as model gap between backbone and full detection framework.

Main Contributions:

1. Introduced SARDet-100K, the first COCO-scale (117K images, 246K instances, 6 categories) benchmark dataset for SAR object detection by standardizing and merging 10 existing datasets.

2. Proposed Multi-Stage with Filter Augmentation (MSFA) pre-training framework to address domain and model gaps in SAR object detection. Includes:

- Filter Augmented Input: Leverages handcrafted features (e.g. Wavelet Scattering) robust to SAR noise to narrow input domain gap.

- Multi-Stage Pretrain: Additional detection pretrain on large-scale aerial optical dataset (DOTA) before SAR fine-tuning acts as domain bridge and reduces gaps.

- Uses full detection framework throughout to enable complete model migration.

3. MSFA achieves new SOTA results on SARDet-100K (+2.1 mAP), SSDD (+5 mAP) and HRSID (+1.9 mAP), showing top effectiveness, generalizability and flexibility.

4. Released SARDet-100K dataset and implementation code to foster further progress. Limitations include focus only on supervised learning.

In summary, this paper contributed a large-scale benchmark SAR dataset, proposed an effective pre-training framework to mitigate domain/model gaps, and achieved new state-of-the-art while releasing open resources to enable future research.
