# [DReg-NeRF: Deep Registration for Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09386)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper aims to address is how to register multiple neural radiance fields (NeRFs) without any human annotations or initializations. Specifically, the paper focuses on solving the problem of aligning multiple NeRFs that are trained independently in different coordinate frames, into the same global coordinate frame. The key hypotheses are:1) Multiple NeRFs capturing overlapping parts of a scene can be aligned using only the pretrained NeRF models, without access to the original training images. 2) The registration can be achieved in a learning based approach using voxel features from the NeRF and a transformer architecture, without needing human annotations or initializations from traditional registration methods.The paper proposes a novel deep learning method called DReg-NeRF that addresses these hypotheses. It extracts voxel features from the NeRF density and radiance fields, and uses a transformer network to predict correspondences between the NeRFs which can then be used to compute the alignment. A key novelty is using the NeRF surface field as supervision for learning correspondences instead of relying on human annotations of overlap. Experiments demonstrate that DReg-NeRF can effectively register NeRFs on complex object-centric scenes, significantly outperforming prior registration methods.In summary, the central hypothesis is that deep learning on implicit NeRF representations can enable robust registration of multiple NeRFs without human supervision or traditional initialization, which is validated through the proposed DReg-NeRF method and experiments. The key innovation is in exploiting NeRF features and surface supervision for learning to register NeRFs in an end-to-end manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a novel network architecture called DReg-NeRF for registering multiple Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) without requiring any human annotations or initializations. 2. Constructing a dataset with over 1700 3D objects from Objaverse for training and evaluating the NeRF registration network.3. Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed DReg-NeRF method can effectively register NeRF blocks and outperforms state-of-the-art point cloud registration methods by a large margin on the test set.4. Introducing techniques like using transformer architectures and surface fields from NeRF models as supervision to enable registration of NeRFs without ground truth overlapping labels.In summary, the key contribution is a learning-based method DReg-NeRF to register multiple NeRF models that does not rely on human interaction or traditional optimization techniques. The method leverages surface fields from NeRF to supervise the learning of correspondences between NeRF blocks. Experiments show the effectiveness of DReg-NeRF for NeRF registration, especially on object-centric scenes.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points comparing this NeRF registration paper to other related work:- Most prior work on NeRF registration relies on traditional optimization methods and requires manual annotation/initialization (e.g. NeRF2NeRF). In contrast, this paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning approach that does not need any manual annotation or initialization.- Compared to point cloud registration methods like FGR and Predator/REGTR, this approach operates directly on implicit NeRF representations rather than explicit point clouds. It shows significantly better results than directly applying point cloud registration to NeRF voxel grids.- The key innovation is using surface fields from NeRF as supervision rather than relying on ground truth point cloud overlap labels. This allows the method to train without any manual annotation of correspondences.- The transformer architecture with self/cross-attention is adapted from recent learned point cloud registration methods, but applied to NeRF voxel features here.- The method is currently demonstrated on a dataset of objects rendered from the Objaverse dataset. It does not tackle large-scale or unbounded scenes like some NeRF papers (e.g. Block-NeRF, Mega-NeRF).- A limitation is that it requires pre-trained NeRF models as input and does not jointly optimize them. Some concurrent work explores end-to-end joint NeRF training and registration.- Overall, this paper presents a novel deep learning approach for NeRF registration that circumvents limitations of prior work. The results are very promising for registering pre-trained NeRF objects without human annotation. Extending it to large scenes and jointly optimizing NeRFs during registration remain open challenges for future work.
