# [Lazy-k: Decoding for Constrained Token Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03367)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores constrained decoding methods for improving structured predictions in token classification models for information extraction. The authors propose a novel algorithm called Lazy-$k$ that efficiently searches for the highest probability label sequence that satisfies predefined constraints. Lazy-$k$ works by iteratively exploring high-likelihood predictions in decreasing order of probability, checking if each candidate solution satisfies the constraints, and stopping once a valid solution is found. Experiments on invoice information extraction datasets demonstrate that Lazy-$k$ decoding can significantly boost model performance, especially for smaller models, by ensuring the extracted information adheres to the expected structure and semantics. A key advantage of Lazy-$k$ is the ease of directly applying non-linear, programmatic constraints without needing complex linear formulations. The method strikes a balance between decoding accuracy and time by allowing flexibility in the number of candidate solutions explored. Overall, constrained decoding is shown to be a promising approach for getting more out of probabilistic models in structured prediction problems.
