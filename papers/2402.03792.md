# [No-Regret Reinforcement Learning in Smooth MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03792)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Obtaining no-regret guarantees for reinforcement learning (RL) in problems with continuous state and action spaces remains a major open challenge. Most theoretical progress has been made under restrictive assumptions like linear MDPs or Lipschitz MDPs. There is a gap between these specific settings and the general continuous RL problem. The paper introduces a novel structural assumption called "smoothness" that generalizes prior settings and allows closing this gap.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper defines two classes of smooth MDPs:

1) Strongly Smooth MDPs where the transition and reward functions have bounded norm in a smoothness space.

2) Weakly Smooth MDPs where the Bellman optimality operator is bounded on the smoothness space. 

The key idea is to use Legendre polynomials, an orthogonal basis, to construct feature maps that approximate the MDP. Two algorithms are proposed:

- Legendre-Eleanor: Proves no-regret under general smoothness assumptions but is computationally inefficient.

- Legendre-LSVI: Runs in polynomial time but requires stronger smoothness. It transforms the MDP into an approximate linear MDP amenable to existing algorithms.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces the smoothness assumption that generalizes major RL settings like Lipschitz, linear and kernelized MDPs

- Develops novel technique using Legendre polynomials to construct feature maps

- Proposes two algorithms with regret guarantees adaptive to the smoothness level

- Legendre-LSVI achieves sqrt(K) regret in broader settings than prior polynomial-time methods

- Results significantly expand the scope of theoretical RL with continuity guarantees

The paper makes an important step towards no-regret RL under general continuity assumptions rather than restrictive parametric assumptions. The use of orthogonal function representations is a key technical innovation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a novel structural assumption of smoothness for Markov decision processes, proposes two Legendre polynomial based algorithms to achieve no-regret guarantees under this assumption, and shows the proposed methods attain better regret rates compared to prior algorithms with similar generality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Introducing two broad classes of MDPs based on the notion of $\nu$-smoothness, called Strongly Smooth MDPs and Weakly Smooth MDPs. These generalize most previous settings studied in RL theory (e.g. Lipschitz MDPs, Linear MDPs, Kernelized MDPs).

2) Developing two novel algorithms, Legendre-Eleanor and Legendre-LSVI, for regret minimization in the proposed smooth MDP settings. These algorithms leverage orthogonal Legendre polynomial features.

3) Providing theoretical analysis showing that under appropriate smoothness conditions, the proposed algorithms achieve no-regret guarantees with rates that depend on and adapt to the smoothness level $\nu$. The rates improve and approach $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{K})$ as smoothness increases.

4) Comparing to prior algorithms and showing that the proposed approaches obtain better regret bounds than general algorithms applied to the same settings, highlighting their value.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing more general smooth MDP settings along with novel associated algorithms that enjoy strong theoretical guarantees and outperform prior methods.

The paper introduces smoothness assumptions on MDPs, including "Strongly Smooth" and "Weakly Smooth" MDPs. It proposes two algorithms, Legendre-Eleanor and Legendre-LSVI, for regret minimization in these smooth MDPs. The algorithms use orthogonal Legendre polynomials to construct representations of the MDPs. The paper analyzes the regret bounds and computational complexity of the proposed methods. It also compares the assumptions and results to other MDP classes studied in RL theory like Lipschitz MDPs, Linear MDPs, and Kernelized MDPs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How exactly does the proposed Legendre polynomial feature mapping allow the authors to reduce a smooth MDP to an approximate linear MDP? What is the intuition behind why this works?

2) The authors introduce two smoothness assumptions on MDPs - strong and weak smoothness. What is the key difference between these assumptions both mathematically and intuitively? When would one be more reasonable to make than the other?

3) The two proposed algorithms, Legendre-Eleanor and Legendre-LSVI, have different strengths and weaknesses in terms of computational efficiency and regret guarantees. Can you characterize the tradeoffs between them and when one would be preferred over the other? 

4) The regret bounds for Legendre-Eleanor and Legendre-LSVI have an exponential dependence on the horizon H. Is it possible to improve this or is this limitation fundamental? How does this compare to other RL algorithms for continuous spaces?

5) How exactly does the inherent Bellman error quantification allow the authors to leverage results from Eleanor in the Legendre-Eleanor algorithm? What is the connection between inherent Bellman error and regret?

6) What is the significance of using an orthogonal feature mapping like Legendre polynomials? How was this validated empirically and what exactly do the results in Figure 1 show?

7) How do the regret guarantees for Legendre-LSVI and Legendre-Eleanor compare with the state-of-the-art for other settings like Lipschitz, linear, or kernelized MDPs? What does Table 1 tell us?

8) The smoothness assumption aims to balance generality and tractability. How does it compare with other common assumptions like Lipschitz continuity? In what ways is it more general and in what ways more restrictive?

9) Could the Legendre polynomial approach be combined with other algorithms like UCRL2 or Thompson sampling? What would the potential benefits be over the Eleanor and LSVI algorithms used in the paper?

10) The motivation discusses why smooth functions are ubiquitous in science/engineering. Is there evidence that RL environments encountered in practice actually satisfy the smoothness assumption to some degree? How could this be validated?
