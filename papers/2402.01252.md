# [Target inductive methods for zero-shot regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01252)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of predicting air pollutant levels at new locations where no weather condition data is available, but information about the surroundings is known. This is framed as a zero-shot regression problem, where the targets are new unseen meteorological stations. Existing zero-shot learning methods focus mainly on classification tasks and are not easily extensible to regression problems. Hence, there is a need for specialized zero-shot regression techniques that can leverage surrounding information as side information to make predictions for new unseen targets.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes two zero-shot regression techniques:

1. Similarity-based Relationship Method: Learns a model per observed target (station) only from features (weather data). Makes predictions for new targets by a weighted aggregation of predictions from observed target models based on similarity of side information. Drawback is potential loss of knowledge from feature models.

2. Parameter Learning Model Correspondence Method: Also learns a model per observed target only from features. Additionally learns a correspondence between observed target side information and parameters of the feature models. Then uses side information of new target to predict model parameters and make predictions. Retains knowledge from feature models better.

These are compared to a baseline method that simply treats side information as additional features.

Contributions:

- Formalizes and provides strategies for target inductive zero-shot regression using side information 

- Proposes two novel zero-shot regression techniques - a relationship-based approach using similarity aggregation and a correspondence-based approach using parameter learning

- Shows experimentally on artificial and real-world datasets that both proposed methods outperform the baseline, with the parameter learning approach showing overall best performance

- Provides comprehensive analysis on the impact of number of targets and side information size on the performance of the methods

- Enriches the zero-shot learning framework with specialized techniques for regression problems, with an application to air pollution prediction

The key highlight is the use of parameter learning to effectively incorporate knowledge from feature models along with side information for superior zero-shot regression performance.
