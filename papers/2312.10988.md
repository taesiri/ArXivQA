## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Graph Invariant Learning with Subgraph Co-mixup for Out-Of-Distribution Generalization":

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) perform well on in-distribution data but fail to generalize on out-of-distribution (OOD) graph data. 
- Existing graph invariant learning methods rely on predefined or generated environment partitions which are often not diverse enough, leading to suboptimal OOD generalization.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel graph invariant learning method based on invariant and variant subgraph co-mixup strategy called IGM.
- Designed an invariant subgraph extractor to identify invariant subgraphs from input graphs.
- Proposed an environment Mixup module to generate environments with sufficient distribution shifts by mixing variant environment-related subgraphs. This facilitates better invariant learning.  
- Designed an invariant Mixup module to mix only the invariant subgraphs. This retains invariant information while preventing impact of spurious correlations for better OOD generalization.
- Showed environment Mixup and invariant Mixup can mutually enhance each other.

Main Contributions:
- First work to automatically generate diverse environments with distribution shifts for effective graph invariant learning.
- Environment Mixup generates environments to enable better invariant learning. 
- Invariant Mixup retains only invariant patterns to mitigate impact of spurious correlations.
- Demonstrated mutual promotion between environment Mixup and invariant Mixup.
- Extensive experiments showed state-of-the-art performance under various distribution shifts on synthetic and real-world graph datasets.

In summary, the key novelty is the invariant and variant subgraph co-mixup strategy to automatically create effective training environments and learn invariant predictive patterns for significantly improved out-of-distribution generalization on graph data.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes a novel graph invariant learning method based on invariant and variant patterns co-mixup strategy for out-of-distribution generalization on graphs. This is the first work to automatically generate diverse environments for graph invariant learning.

2. It designs an environment Mixup module to generate environments which have sufficient distribution shifts, leading to better invariant learning on graphs. 

3. It proposes an invariant Mixup method to encourage the mixed-up data to only retain invariant graph patterns, mitigating the impact of spurious correlations. The paper shows that the environment Mixup and invariant Mixup modules can mutually enhance each other.

4. It conducts extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various types of distribution shifts. For example, it achieves an average improvement of 7.4% on real-world datasets.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel mixup-based graph invariant learning framework that can automatically generate diverse environments and capture invariant patterns for effective out-of-distribution generalization on graphs. Both the tailored environment mixup and invariant mixup strategies play an important role.
