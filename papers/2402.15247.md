# [A Bargaining-based Approach for Feature Trading in Vertical Federated   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15247)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- In vertical federated learning (VFL), the task party acts as a data consumer who buys features from the data party. Current practices price the data party's entire dataset and assume transactions happen before performing VFL. 
- This can lead to underpayment or overpayment issues as the utility of features depends on the task party's application scenario which is unknown to the data party. Also, buying all features may include some that do not improve model performance. 
- There is a need for a more nuanced and economically efficient approach to feature trading in VFL.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a bargaining-based feature trading approach for VFL to encourage efficient transactions. 
- Incorporate performance gain-based pricing by linking payment to the improvement in model performance from using the traded features. This ties payment to feature utility.
- Formulate revenue optimization objectives for both the task party and data party. Task party aims to maximize net profit while data party aims to maximize payment received.
- Model the bargaining as an iterative process of the task party quoting a price and data party responding with a feature bundle offer until agreement or breakdown. Task party leads as it knows model utility rate and budget.

Main Contributions:
- Identify the need for efficient feature trading in VFL and propose a bargaining model to address this.
- Design bargaining model with performance gain based pricing and analyze it under perfect/imperfect information settings.
- Prove existence of equilibrium optimizing objectives of both parties under perfect information.
- Develop estimation-based bargaining strategies for imperfect information setting.
- Discuss security issues and solutions for the VFL market.
- Demonstrate effectiveness of proposed model through experiments on real-world datasets.

The paper makes a novel attempt at addressing economic inefficiencies in VFL feature trading through a bargaining framework. The analysis and experimental results highlight the promise of this idea.
