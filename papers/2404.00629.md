# [Against The Achilles' Heel: A Survey on Red Teaming for Generative   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00629)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the landscape of red teaming for generative AI models, specifically focusing on large language models (LLMs). Its main contributions include:

1) Proposing a novel taxonomy to categorize LLM attack strategies based on inherent capabilities that arise from the models' pretraining and fine-tuning, such as completion compliance, instruction following, generalization, and model manipulation. This provides a more systematic perspective compared to taxonomies based on surface features of attacks.

2) Framing the automatic generation of attack prompts as search problems and drawing an analogy to components of search algorithms. This view unlocks a broader design space for developing automated red teaming methods in the future. 

3) Covering emerging research areas related to LLM safety including multilingual and multimodal attacks, overkill of harmless queries, and risks in LLM-based downstream applications like dialogue agents. 

4) Discussing the entire pipeline from risk taxonomy, attack strategies, evaluation metrics and benchmarks to defense approaches. This provides a holistic overview of the LLM safety landscape.

In summary, this paper offers a structured, comprehensive analysis of approaches, issues and opportunities around red teaming for generative AI, with an eye towards steering the field towards developing more secure, ethical and reliable models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts covered in this paper include:

- Red teaming - The practice of simulating attacks to identify vulnerabilities in AI systems. Also referred to as prompt attacks, jailbreaking, adversarial attacks.

- Risk taxonomy - Categorization of different types of risks posed by language models, such as ethical, legal, financial, privacy risks. 

- Attack strategies - Methods to craft inputs that induce unsafe, biased or harmful outputs from generative AI models, utilizing capabilities like completion tendencies, instruction following, reasoning, etc.

- Searchers - Automated approaches to systematically discover vulnerabilities by searching over prompts/suffixes to optimize attack objectives.

- Defense strategies - Techniques to safeguard models against attacks, applied during training (fine-tuning, RLHF) or inference (prompting, output filtering).

- Benchmarks - Standardized datasets and protocols to evaluate attack success rates, safety metrics, model robustness against jailbreaking attempts. 

- Multilinguality - Attacks exploiting limitations in multilingual safety alignment.

- Multimodality - Attacks on vision-language models using adversarial images, text prompts.

- Applications - Vulnerabilities in LLM-based applications and agent systems.

In summary, this paper provides a structured taxonomy grounded in model capabilities to analyze the landscape of attacks, defenses and risks associated with generative AI systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors propose a taxonomy of attack strategies grounded in inherent capabilities like autoregressive modeling and instruction following. How does basing the taxonomy on model capabilities provide a more fundamental classification compared to surface-level features of attack strategies? 

2. The authors frame automated red teaming methods as search problems and break them down into state spaces, goals, and operations. In what ways does this formulation help better understand and advance the design of automated attack techniques?

3. The authors pay special attention to emerging attack strategies like role play and psychological manipulation. What novel vulnerabilities do these methods expose in language models and why might they represent particularly dangerous threats?  

4. A key idea in the paper is tracing common attack strategies back to conflicts in model training, like the clash between helpfulness and harmlessness. What are some ways to address these deeper conflicts in order to develop more robust language models?  

5. Multilingual attacks are shown to be highly effective due to uneven multilingual alignment. What specific challenges contribute to the difficulty of achieving safety alignment across diverse languages?  

6. Fine-tuning is demonstrated as an effective attack vector for compromised safety. How might insights from continual and lifelong learning be applied to mitigate risks related to catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning?

7. The authors highlight the problem of overkill - models becoming overly sensitive and refusing harmless queries. What are some ways overkill could be automatically detected and addressed?  

8. The survey discusses attack risks and safeguards for vision-language models. In what ways do properties of continuous image inputs pose distinct security challenges compared to discrete text?

9. The authors emphasize systematic coverage of risks and attacks as an area needing improvement. What kind of organizational frameworks could support more systematic exploration of model vulnerabilities?  

10. What kinds of industry-academic collaboration could help address the arms race between attacks and defenses for generative AI? What incentives could facilitate greater openness and coordination?
