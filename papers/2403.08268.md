# [Follow-Your-Click: Open-domain Regional Image Animation via Short   Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08268)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing image-to-video (I2V) methods lack controllability over which parts of the image should be animated, and tend to move the entire scene. They also require redundant text prompts to describe the frame contents in addition to the desired motion. These limitations hinder their practical usage.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes "Follow-Your-Click", an I2V framework that allows regional image animation using only a user click (specifying where to move) and a short motion prompt (specifying how to move). 

The key technical contributions are:

1) First-frame masking strategy: Randomly masking the input image latent during training significantly improves video generation quality.

2) Motion-augmented module & short prompt dataset: A new module and dataset focusing on motion keywords enhance the model's sensitivity to short motion prompts.  

3) Flow-based motion magnitude control: Optical flow magnitude is used to accurately control the speed of target object motions.

The proposed simple click + short prompt interaction facilitates intuitive control over regional animation. Experiments show superior performance over 7 baselines on 8 evaluation metrics. Qualitative results demonstrate more precise region-specific animation and better prompt following ability.

Limitations include difficulty with large, complex human motions due to dataset biases. But the framework could potentially integrate human pose input for finer motion control.

In summary, this paper introduces the first I2V method for controllable regional animation through intuitive click and short prompt interactions, enabled by innovations in training strategies and motion control.
