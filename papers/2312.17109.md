# [MIVC: Multiple Instance Visual Component for Visual-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17109)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing vision-language models assume a one-to-one pairing between images and text during pre-training. However, in real applications, there can be a one-to-many or many-to-one relationship between images and text. 
- For example, in e-commerce scenarios, multiple product images depicting different views and details correspond to a single textual description. 
- Simply concatenating images or taking one image loses information. Existing models lack capabilities to effectively consolidate information from multiple images and align it with language models.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose MIVC, a Multiple Instance Visual Component, to bridge multiple image inputs with off-the-shelf vision-language models like BLIP.
- MIVC employs attention-based pooling strategies from multiple instance learning to consolidate representations from multiple images into one representation that retains essential information.
- This pooled representation is concatenated with text and fed into the language model for generative downstream tasks.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces an innovative multiple instance learning framework in multimodal representation learning that can handle varying numbers of images corresponding to text.
- Achieves significant improvement in fusing multimodal information for tasks like product categorization, attribute inference, caption generation over baselines.
- Provides interpretability by identifying image contributions through the learned attention weights.
- MIVC component is compatible with existing VLMs and introduces negligible computational overhead.

In summary, the paper presents MIVC to effectively leverage multiple images as input to vision-language models for improved performance on multimodal generative tasks, with wide applicability in real-world scenarios.
