# [Universal Debiased Editing for Fair Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06104)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
With the rapid adoption of foundation models (FMs) and their APIs in healthcare, there is a pressing need to address the bias present in the FM embeddings. Such biases can lead to unfair predictions and disparate impact across different demographic groups. However, modifying the FM models directly is infeasible due to lack of access and difficultly in ensuring debiasing works across various downstream tasks. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a novel image editing framework called Universal Debiased Editing (UDE) to remove bias at the input level before feeding to FM API. Specifically, they learn an UDE noise that can mask sensitive attributes from images while preserving fidelity. This UDE noise is optimized to confuse a pre-trained sensitive attribute (e.g. gender) classifier. Crucially, UDE editing is task-agnostic and can work across various disease classification tasks that use the FM API embeddings. The authors also design a greedy zeroth order optimization strategy called GeZO to enable UDE optimization under black-box APIs where gradients are not accessible.

Main Contributions:
- Propose first image editing framework UDE to remove bias when using pretrained FM image embeddings across tasks 
- UDE optimizes noise to break spurious correlation between sensitive attributes and labels in embedding
- Introduce GeZO strategy to enable UDE under black-box API constraints 
- Achieve state-of-the-art fairness and utility tradeoff over baselines on three medical diagnosis tasks
- Demonstrate UDE's interpretability via visualization of edited images and noise heatmaps

The key novelty lies in the universal applicability of UDE for debiasing without needing model access or task specifications. Experiments validate UDE's effectiveness to enhance fairness in medical image classification using FM APIs.
