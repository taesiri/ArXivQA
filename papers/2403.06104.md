# [Universal Debiased Editing for Fair Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06104)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
With the rapid adoption of foundation models (FMs) and their APIs in healthcare, there is a pressing need to address the bias present in the FM embeddings. Such biases can lead to unfair predictions and disparate impact across different demographic groups. However, modifying the FM models directly is infeasible due to lack of access and difficultly in ensuring debiasing works across various downstream tasks. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a novel image editing framework called Universal Debiased Editing (UDE) to remove bias at the input level before feeding to FM API. Specifically, they learn an UDE noise that can mask sensitive attributes from images while preserving fidelity. This UDE noise is optimized to confuse a pre-trained sensitive attribute (e.g. gender) classifier. Crucially, UDE editing is task-agnostic and can work across various disease classification tasks that use the FM API embeddings. The authors also design a greedy zeroth order optimization strategy called GeZO to enable UDE optimization under black-box APIs where gradients are not accessible.

Main Contributions:
- Propose first image editing framework UDE to remove bias when using pretrained FM image embeddings across tasks 
- UDE optimizes noise to break spurious correlation between sensitive attributes and labels in embedding
- Introduce GeZO strategy to enable UDE under black-box API constraints 
- Achieve state-of-the-art fairness and utility tradeoff over baselines on three medical diagnosis tasks
- Demonstrate UDE's interpretability via visualization of edited images and noise heatmaps

The key novelty lies in the universal applicability of UDE for debiasing without needing model access or task specifications. Experiments validate UDE's effectiveness to enhance fairness in medical image classification using FM APIs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a universal debiased editing (UDE) method that adds optimized noise to medical images to eliminate sensitive attribute information from foundation model embeddings, enabling fairer disease classification across tasks when using these model APIs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a universal debiased editing (UDE) strategy called UDE to mitigate bias when using embeddings from a pre-trained foundation model (FM) API for medical image classification. Specifically:

1) UDE generates UDE noise that masks spurious correlations between sensitive attributes (e.g. gender) and targets (e.g. diseases) in medical images. This allows removing bias both within the FM API embedding and the images themselves.

2) UDE is suitable for both white-box and black-box FM APIs. For black-box APIs where gradient is not accessible, a Greedy Zeroth-Order (GeZO) optimization strategy is introduced. 

3) The UDE noise can be applied to input images to generate fair embeddings from the FM API and achieve unbiased disease classification across various downstream tasks. This makes UDE a "universal" debiasing solution.

4) Extensive experiments demonstrate UDE's effectiveness in promoting fairness while preserving utility across different patient groups and diseases.

In summary, the key innovation is a practical and universal solution to address bias when using medical image embeddings from pretrained FM APIs for various classification tasks, under both white-box and black-box settings.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Foundation Models (FM) - The paper focuses on using pretrained image foundation models that provide embedding services through APIs.

- Fairness - A main goal of the paper is to address fairness issues and mitigate bias when using FM embeddings, especially related to sensitive attributes like gender.

- Universal Debiased Editing (UDE) - The proposed method that adds noise to images to eliminate spurious correlations between sensitive attributes and labels while maintaining utility. 

- Greedy Zero-order Optimization (GeZO) - The optimization strategy introduced to enable UDE to work in black-box settings where gradients are not accessible.

- Medical image classification - The paper evaluates UDE on mitigating gender bias and improving fairness for medical image classification tasks like pneumonia, edema, and pleural effusion detection.

- Equal opportunity (EO) and Disparate impact (DI) - Fairness metrics used to evaluate the method's ability to provide equitable predictions across groups defined by the sensitive attribute.

In summary, the key focus is on developing a universal editing approach called UDE to improve fairness in medical image classification when using pretrained foundation model APIs, even in black-box scenarios.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a universal debias editing (UDE) strategy to mitigate bias when using foundation model (FM) APIs for medical image classification. What is the key motivation behind proposing a data-based strategy like UDE instead of a model-based or prediction calibration-based strategy?

2. How does the proposed UDE strategy eliminate the spurious correlation between sensitive attributes (SAs) and disease labels? Explain the process of training the UDE noise.

3. The paper claims UDE is suitable for both white-box and black-box FM APIs. How does the proposed GeZO optimization strategy estimate gradients and update UDE noise when gradients are not accessible in black-box APIs?

4. What are the advantages of using an input-space noise based strategy like UDE over directly editing the FM API embeddings? Explain with examples from the paper.

6. How does the paper evaluate both fairness and utility? What metrics are used and what do they signify about the model performance?

7. The ablation study explores the impact of the regularization term lambda in the UDE objective. How does increasing lambda affect both fairness and utility metrics? Provide possible explanations.

8. For GeZO optimization, how does the number of local iterations impact optimization performance in terms of both fairness and utility? What is the trade-off involved?

9. The paper provides visualizations of images modified with UDE noise. How do these visualizations demonstrate that UDE preserves fidelity while removing spurious gender correlations?

10. The normalized UDE noise map identifies likely regions containing gender information. What are some pros and cons of using such visualizations to interpret sensitive attributes?
