# [OpenVoice: Versatile Instant Voice Cloning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01479)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Instant voice cloning (IVC) aims to clone a speaker's voice from a short reference audio to generate new speech, but faces challenges in flexible control of voice styles, cross-lingual capabilities, and computational efficiency. 

- Previous IVC methods either lack control over emotions, accents etc beyond tone color (VALLE, XTTS), require large multilingual datasets (YourTTS, Voicebox), or are slow due to autoregressive models (VALLE, XTTS).

Proposed Solution 
- OpenVoice decouples tone color cloning from control of other vocal styles using a base TTS model and a tone color converter.

- The base TTS model allows control over emotion, accents, languages etc. The tone color converter embodies the tone of the reference audio into the base TTS output.

- The tone converter uses flow layers conditioned on tone embeddings to extract style-invariant representations, enabling style preservation and cross-lingual capabilities.

Key Contributions
- Accurate tone color cloning from reference audios of unseen languages

- Flexible control over various vocal styles like emotion and accent on top of tone cloning  

- Zero-shot cross-lingual cloning without need for multilingual datasets

- Faster than commercial systems with 12x real-time CPU inference 

- Open-sourced with weights at https://github.com/myshell-ai/OpenVoice to facilitate research

In summary, OpenVoice sets new benchmarks in flexible style control and cross-lingual voice cloning for IVC through a decoupled model design and style-invariant representations. The open-source release aims to spur further innovations in this space.
