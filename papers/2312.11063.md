# [A survey on algorithms for Nash equilibria in finite normal-form games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11063)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper provides a comprehensive review and classification of algorithms for computing Nash equilibria in normal-form games, focusing on the case of two-player bimatrix games. 

It first introduces key concepts and notation, including the notions of Nash equilibria, approximate Nash equilibria (ε-NE), and well-supported approximate Nash equilibria (ε-WSNE). It then reviews complexity results, showing that computing exact Nash equilibria is likely intractable, even in two-player games, but that constant-factor approximate equilibria can be computed in polynomial time.

The paper classifies Nash equilibrium algorithms into several categories:

- Brute-force search algorithms that enumerate strategy supports 
- Algorithms for exact equilibria in two-player zero-sum and general games, including linear programming and the Lemke-Howson algorithm
- Polynomial-time "search-and-mix" algorithms for constant-factor ε-NE, including recent state-of-the-art algorithms achieving a 1/3 approximation
- Polynomial-time algorithms for constant-factor ε-WSNE based on solving related zero-sum games 
- Heuristic learning dynamics like fictitious play and no-regret learning
- Other algorithms for general multi-player games

The paper also presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation, comparing approximation quality, runtime efficiency, numerical stability, and other practical metrics across algorithms on both random games and standard game distributions. Key findings include:

- Search-and-mix algorithms often perform much better than their worst-case guarantees 
- Learning dynamics work well on structured games but slower on random games
- Precision issues can arise when using LP solvers
- Enumeration algorithms scale poorly, while others like TS07-0.3393 are efficient

Finally, the paper discusses open problems and challenges that remain. Overall, it provides a thorough review of the state-of-the-art in Nash equilibrium computation along with new empirical insights, guiding both theoretical and practical work in this area.
