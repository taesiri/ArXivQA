# [On Predictive planning and counterfactual learning in active inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12417)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper examines two decision-making schemes in the active inference framework - one based on planning for the future (DPEFE) and one based on learning from experience (counterfactual learning or CL). The goal is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and explore ways to balance them. 

The DPEFE scheme uses predictive planning to evaluate future outcomes and make optimal decisions. However, the computational complexity scales exponentially with the planning depth/horizon. The CL scheme learns a state-action mapping based on experience and risk evaluation. It is computationally cheaper but requires more environmental interactions to learn effectively.  

There is a trade-off between data efficiency and computational complexity between the two methods. Biological agents likely employ a mix of planning and experiential learning.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a mixed model to balance planning and learning. A bias parameter β(s,t) keeps track of the agent's relative confidence in each scheme for a given state. It gets updated based on the relative entropy/uncertainty of the action distributions from each scheme. 

A new distribution P(u|s)_MM mixes the DPEFE and CL distributions weighted by β. This allows the agent to leverage its experience as well as look ahead where beneficial. The update rules for β and P_MM are derived from variational free energy minimization.

Contributions:

- Comparison of two decision-making schemes in active inference - planning-based DPEFE and experience-based CL
- Identifying a trade-off between data efficiency and computational complexity
- A mixed model that balances planning and learning by tracking confidence in each scheme
- Testing in environments requiring reactive (cartpole) and strategic (maze navigation) control
- Demonstrating the mixed model's adaptability in a mutating maze environment 
- Providing insights into decision-making through the evolution of model parameters

The mixed model balances computational resources and data availability. It is adaptable as complexity increases, much like biological organisms. Analyzing the model parameters also enables better explainability of the basis of intelligent behavior.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a mixed model that balances predictive planning and counterfactual learning for efficient decision-making in active inference agents.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a mixed model that combines two decision-making schemes in active inference:

1) The DPEFE (Dynamic Programming in Expected Free Energy) scheme based on predictive planning.

2) The CL (Counterfactual Learning) scheme based on learning from experience. 

The paper compares the performance of these two schemes on different tasks - the DPEFE scheme performs better on strategic tasks like maze navigation which require planning, while the CL scheme is more suitable for spontaneous control tasks like balancing a pole.

To leverage the complementary strengths of both schemes, the paper introduces a mixed model with a state-dependent bias parameter β that allows the agent to balance planning and counterfactual learning. The update rules for β and the mixed model action distribution are derived from variational free energy minimization.

The proposed mixed model is shown to enable efficient decision making by balancing data-efficiency and computational complexity. Its performance is demonstrated in a mutating maze environment. The evolution of model parameters also provides insights into the explainability of the agent's intelligent behavior.

In summary, the key contribution is a mixed model that integrates predictive planning and counterfactual learning schemes in active inference to achieve efficient and adaptable decision making.

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Active inference
- Decision making
- Data-complexity trade-off  
- Hybrid models
- Predictive planning

- POMDP-based generative models
- Dynamic programming in expected free energy (DPEFE)

- Explainability

The paper compares two decision-making schemes in active inference - one based on predictive planning (DPEFE) and the other based on counterfactual learning. It examines the data-complexity trade-off between these approaches and proposes a hybrid model that balances both schemes. The hybrid model is evaluated in challenging environments that require adaptability. The evolution of parameters like the risk factor and model bias provides insights into the explainability of decision-making. So the key terms reflect this focus on decision-making strategies, their comparison, the proposed hybrid approach, and analyze model parameters for explainability.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a mixed model that combines planning-based decision-making (DPEFE) and counterfactual learning (CL). What is the motivation behind combining these two approaches? How do they complement each other?

2. The update rule for the model mixing parameter beta (Eq. 4) depends on comparing the entropies of the action distributions from DPEFE and CL. Explain the intuition behind using entropy to determine the relative usefulness of the two schemes. 

3. The paper shows formally that the update rules for beta and the mixed model action distribution can be derived from variational free energy minimization. Walk through the key steps of this derivation. What does this tell you about the underlying objective being optimized?

4. The mixed model is evaluated on a mutating grid world task. What was the purpose of having the environment mutate, and what does the agent's performance reveal about the adaptability of the approach?

5. How does the mixed model balance computational complexity and data efficiency, compared to using DPEFE or CL alone? Explain this "data-complexity trade-off" concept. 

6. The risk parameter Gamma in CL is shown to spike when the environment mutates. Similarly, the bias parameter beta adapts depending on the planning ability of the agent. Discuss what these trends reveal about the explainability of the model.

7. What would be the key steps involved in scaling up the mixed model to solve more complex decision-making tasks? What modifications might be necessary?

8. The paper mentions comparing the mixed model approach to ANN-based active inference schemes. What benefits might the mixed model provide over ANN implementations in terms of explainability?

9. Could the concepts behind the mixed model, such as balancing planning and counterfactual learning, be applied to other decision-making frameworks like reinforcement learning? Why or why not?

10. What biological evidence is there that the brain employs complementary decision-making strategies? Does the mixed model provide insights into efficient computational principles that might be used by the brain?
