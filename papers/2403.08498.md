# [Gaussian Splatting in Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08498)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Gaussian Splatting in Style":

Problem: 
The paper tackles the problem of neural scene stylization, which refers to transferring the style of a given image (e.g. a painting) to novel views rendered of a 3D scene. A key challenge is to maintain consistency of the stylized appearance across different viewpoints. Most prior works achieve this by optimizing the scene specifically for each style image, which is slow. 

Method:
The paper proposes a novel real-time scene stylization method called "Gaussian Splatting in Style" (GSS) based on representing the scene using explicit 3D Gaussians from 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). At training time, the pretrained 3D Gaussians are processed by a tiny MLP and multi-resolution hash grid conditioned on style images to predict a stylized RGB color for each Gaussian. At test time, novel stylized views can be rendered for new styles not seen during training by feeding the style image into an encoder and rendering the Gaussians with their predicted colors.

Key Contributions:
- First method to perform neural scene stylization using an explicit 3D Gaussian scene representation, ensuring spatial consistency.
- Real-time rendering of stylized novel views at 150 FPS, enabling use for VR/AR.  
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual quality and quantitative consistency metrics compared to other methods.
- Efficient training that requires only 2 hours per scene.
- Provides a generalizable model that can render novel stylized views for unseen styles.

In summary, the key novelty is a real-time neural scene stylization approach using 3D Gaussians that generates high visual quality, consistent stylized novel views for arbitrary styles provided at test time. This enables practical use cases like avatar modelling and scene editing for VR/AR applications.
