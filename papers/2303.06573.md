# [Large Language Models Know Your Contextual Search Intent: A Prompting   Framework for Conversational Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06573)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can large language models be leveraged to perform few-shot conversational query rewriting for conversational search? Specifically, the paper proposes a prompting framework called LLMCS that harnesses large language models like GPT-3 to generate query rewrites and hypothetical responses for conversational search queries. The key hypothesis is that the powerful language generation and contextual understanding abilities of large LMs can help accurately capture the user's search intent from the conversational context, even with very few examples, thereby improving search performance. To test this hypothesis, the authors explore three prompting methods (REW, RTR, RAR) to stimulate the LM to produce informative query rewrites and responses from different perspectives. They also aggregate multiple generations using techniques like self-consistency and averaging. The main experiments are conducted on two conversational search datasets - CAsT-19 and CAsT-20. The results demonstrate that LLMCS significantly outperforms previous baselines and even manual rewrites, highlighting the potential of leveraging large LMs for contextual query rewriting and conversational search through careful prompting.In summary, the central research question is on utilizing large LMs for few-shot conversational query rewriting via prompting, and the hypothesis is that the LM's strong language abilities can help accurately infer search intent from contexts with minimal training data. The experiments support the hypothesis and highlight the promise of this direction.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a prompting framework called LLMCS that leverages large language models like GPT-3 to perform few-shot conversational query rewriting for conversational search, shows that generating hypothetical responses and aggregating multiple generations significantly improves performance, and demonstrates superior results over strong baselines on two CAsT benchmarks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key aspects in comparing this paper to other related work in conversational search and leveraging large language models:- This paper focuses specifically on conversational passage retrieval, which aims to retrieve relevant passages for users' queries in a conversational setting. This is an important subtask in conversational search. Other related work has explored conversational answer ranking, knowledge-grounded dialog systems, etc. - The key novelty is using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 in a prompting framework for few-shot conversational query rewriting. Most prior work on conversational search relies on traditional IR models or neural ranking models trained on manual query-passage pairs. Leveraging LLMs' strong few-shot abilities is a new direction.- The prompting framework includes 3 tailored prompting methods to generate multiple rewrites and responses from the LLM, and aggregates them as robust query representations. This is a unique way to leverage LLMs compared to simply using LLMs to directly generate a single rewrite.- Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks CAsT-19 and CAsT-20 demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. The generative ability and contextual understanding of LLMs prove very effective for this task.- The results highlight the potential of LLMs for conversational search. But there is still room for improvement in prompt engineering and tuning generation strategies. Evaluating on more diverse datasets would also be useful.- Overall, this is an interesting and novel application of LLMs. The prompting framework and empirical results advance the state-of-the-art in conversational passage retrieval. More work can build on this direction to develop stronger conversational search systems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions the authors suggest are:1. Evaluate the LLMCS framework on more conversational search datasets to further test its generalizability. The authors mention evaluating on datasets like CAsT-21 and QReCC.2. Conduct human evaluations to assess the quality of the query rewrites generated by LLMCS. This could reveal limitations and inspire improvements to the prompting methods.3. Investigate the effects of different model settings like the number of exemplars and generations.4. Design zero-shot promptings for models like text-davinci-003 and ChatGPT, and evaluate their performance.5. Explore using the information generated by large language models to augment training of conversational dense retrievers.In summary, the main future directions focus on further evaluating LLMCS on more datasets, probing the quality of its outputs through human evaluation, tuning model hyperparameters, exploring zero-shot prompting, and using LLMCS to improve conversational dense retrievers. The authors aim to better understand the capabilities and limitations of LLMCS for conversational search through these avenues.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:This paper presents a prompting framework called LLMCS that leverages large language models like GPT-3 to perform few-shot conversational query rewriting for conversational search. The key idea is to prompt the language model with carefully designed templates that include conversation examples and instructions to generate query rewrites and hypothetical responses. The prompts are designed to get the model to infer the user's search intent from the conversation context. Three prompting methods are explored: Rewriting Prompt to generate a rewrite, Rewriting-Then-Response Prompt to generate a rewrite followed by a hypothetical response, and Rewriting-And-Response Prompt to jointly generate a rewrite and response. Multiple prompt generations are aggregated using techniques like self-consistency and averaging to obtain a robust search intent representation. This representation is used to retrieve relevant passages. Experiments on two datasets show significant improvements over baselines by properly prompting large language models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of conversational passage retrieval, which is an important component of conversational search systems. Specifically, the paper focuses on the challenge of reformulating the user's conversational queries into effective standalone queries that capture the full context and intent, a process known as conversational query rewriting (CQR). The key issues and limitations with existing CQR methods that the paper identifies are:- CQR models require a lot of expensive manual query rewrites as training data, but such data is scarce due to the diversity and long-tail nature of conversational search sessions. This limits the effectiveness and robustness of existing models.- Existing models focus on fitting the limited training data, but are not optimized directly for search performance.To address these issues, the main contribution of the paper is a prompting framework called LLMCS that leverages large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to perform few-shot conversational query rewriting in a more data-efficient and search-oriented manner.Specifically, the key ideas and components of LLMCS include:- Designing three prompting methods (REW, RTR, RAR) to generate multiple query rewrites and responses from the LLM with different contextual perspectives.- Incorporating chain-of-thought prompting to guide the LLM's reasoning towards the user's true search intent. - Aggregating the generated rewrites and responses into a robust search intent representation that integrates their collaborative signals.So in summary, the paper aims to effectively utilize the contextual reasoning and generation capabilities of LLMs to address the core challenges of conversational query rewriting and passage retrieval in a low-resource setting.
