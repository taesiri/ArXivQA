# [Dynamic Multi-Network Mining of Tensor Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11773)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Dynamic Multi-Network Mining of Tensor Time Series":

Problem:
- Tensor time series (TTS) data is becoming increasingly common with the rise of IoT devices. TTS data has multiple modes besides the temporal mode, such as sensor type, location, etc. 
- Performing interpretable subsequence clustering on TTS data is challenging due to its complexity stemming from multiple modes and intricate dependencies. 
- Existing time series clustering methods either focus only on univariate/multivariate data or use simple models not suitable for TTS data. They also lack interpretability of clustering results.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new method called "Dynamic Multi-Network Mining (DMM)" for subsequence clustering of TTS data.
- Each cluster is characterized by multiple sparse dependency networks, one for each non-temporal mode. This provides interpretability into key relationships.
- An optimization criterion based on minimum description length (MDL) principle is used to determine cluster assignments, number of clusters, segments and model parameters.

Main Contributions:
- Interpretable: Clusters are modeled by multiple networks per non-temporal mode to provide visual and interpretable insights.
- Accurate: Optimization criterion based on MDL allows determining all parameters and achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods. 
- Scalable: Algorithm scales linearly in terms of input size and applicable to long-range and high-dimensional TTS data.
- Useful for understanding TTS data by providing interpretable clustering results and relationships among variables in different modes.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective and scalable method for interpretable subsequence clustering of tensor time series data using dynamic multi-mode networks.
