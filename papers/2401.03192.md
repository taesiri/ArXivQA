# [On the Convergence of Hermitian Dynamic Mode Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03192)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the convergence properties of Hermitian Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HDMD), a data-driven method for approximating spectral properties of self-adjoint Koopman operators. Koopman operators are infinite-dimensional linear operators that capture the dynamics of nonlinear systems. HDMD aims to compute finite-dimensional approximations to Koopman operators that preserve self-adjointness, ensuring real eigenvalues and an interpretation via spectral measures. However, it was unknown if the spectral approximations from HDMD converge. 

Proposed Solution:
The main contribution is proving the convergence of the spectral measures computed by HDMD to the actual spectral measures of the underlying Koopman operator, under suitable assumptions. Specifically, they show that the eigenvalues and spectral projectors associated with eigenfunctions of the finite-dimensional HDMD approximations converge to eigenvalues and spectral projectors of the Koopman operator. The proof relies on showing the convergence of resolvents combined with the Stone-Weierstrass theorem.

Along the way, the authors make two additional contributions:
(1) They provide a simplified and more numerically stable algorithm to compute the HDMD approximations compared to previous work. 
(2) They prove a general theorem on the convergence of spectral measures for projections of self-adjoint operators in Hilbert spaces, which may be of broader interest.

The theoretical results are demonstrated on numerically approximating spectral properties of the 2D Schrödinger equation, where the HDMD method recovers eigenvalues and eigenfunctions accurately.

In summary, this paper provides theoretical guarantees for the HDMD method to reliably approximate spectral properties of self-adjoint Koopman operators associated with potentially nonlinear dynamical systems. The results lend credibility to using HDMD in applications for extracting dynamical information from data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proves the convergence of Hermitian Dynamic Mode Decomposition, a data-driven method for approximating self-adjoint Koopman operators, to the true spectral properties of the underlying Koopman operator.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proving the convergence of Hermitian Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to the spectral properties of self-adjoint Koopman operators. Specifically:

- The paper develops a general theorem (Theorem 1) showing the convergence of spectral measures for sequences of projections onto finite-dimensional subspaces of a Hilbert space. This may be of broader interest beyond the application to Hermitian DMD.

- Using this result, Theorem 2 shows that under suitable assumptions, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions computed by Hermitian DMD converge to the actual spectral properties of the underlying (self-adjoint) Koopman operator. 

- This provides theoretical justification for using Hermitian DMD to compute finite-dimensional approximations of Koopman operators while preserving important spectral structure like self-adjointness.

- The convergence result for Hermitian DMD was previously lacking despite its increasing use. This paper helps fill this theoretical gap.

In summary, the main contribution is the rigorous convergence analysis of Hermitian DMD, demonstrating it can reliably approximate spectral properties of self-adjoint Koopman operators. The general theorem on convergence of spectral measures may also be of broader interest.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)
- Extended DMD (EDMD) 
- Koopman operators
- Hermitian DMD
- Self-adjoint operators
- Spectral convergence
- Spectral measures
- Convergence theorems
- Schrödinger equation
- Computational example

The paper studies the convergence properties of Hermitian Dynamic Mode Decomposition, a variant of DMD that preserves self-adjointness (Hermiticity) when approximating Koopman operators associated with nonlinear dynamical systems. It provides convergence theorems for the spectral measures computed by Hermitian DMD approaching those of the underlying self-adjoint Koopman operator. Key mathematical concepts revolve around spectral theory of operators, including spectral measures and self-adjointness. The numerical example applies Hermitian DMD to the Schrödinger equation. So in summary, the key terms have to do with Koopman operator theory, spectral convergence analysis, and structure-preserving DMD methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper defines a core $S\subset \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{L})$. What is the significance of this core set? Why is the assumption that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mathcal{L}\mathcal{P}_n^*\mathcal{P}_nu=\mathcal{L}u$ for all $u\in S$ key for the convergence result?

2) The proof of Lemma 1 relies on the boundedness of $\mathcal{L}$ to prove the convergence of moments. Why does this argument fail for unbounded operators? What issues arise when trying to directly match moments?

3) Theorem 1 proves a more general convergence result. How does the use of rational functions and the Stone-Weierstrass theorem help to establish vague convergence in this result? Why is it then still necessary to upgrade this to weak convergence?

4) Theorem 2 specializes the result of Theorem 1 to the case of Hermitian DMD. Why is it important that Hermitian DMD produces real spectra so that the measures $\mu_{\gv_N}^{(M)}$ are supported on $\mathbb{R}$?

5) The numerical example applies Hermitian DMD to the 2D Schrödinger equation. What is the physical interpretation of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions discovered by this method? How do they relate to the dynamics?

6) In the numerical example, how exactly are the spectral measures $\mu_{f,N}$ computed? What is the significance of the coefficients $c_j$?

7) The dictionary functions used in the example are Gaussian bumps. How do properties like width and placement of these bumps affect accuracy and convergence? Is there an optimal selection?

8) The example uses a simple trapezoidal rule for discretization. How might the choice of quadrature rule impact theoretical convergence guarantees? When might high-order rules be beneficial?

9) The paper addresses self-adjoint Koopman operators. What changes would be needed to handle skew-Hermitian operators? What other structures beyond Hermitian could be exploited?

10) A core application area for DMD methods is fluid dynamics. What types of dynamics arise in fluids where Hermitian structure could be leveraged? How might this benefit analysis?
