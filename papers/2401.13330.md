# [NACHOS: Neural Architecture Search for Hardware Constrained Early Exit   Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13330)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of designing optimal Early Exit Neural Networks (EENNs). EENNs are neural networks that have multiple early exit points with classifiers that can make predictions earlier in the network if enough confidence is achieved. Manually designing EENNs is complex as it requires optimizing multiple aspects like the placement and thresholds of exits and managing the computational overhead. Thus, there is a need for automated Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods to design optimal EENNs.

Solution - NACHOS Framework:
The paper proposes NACHOS, a NAS framework to automatically design hardware-constrained EENNs optimized for accuracy under a constraint on multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. NACHOS performs a multi-objective search to find Pareto optimal EENNs using the NSGA-II genetic algorithm. 

Key aspects:
- It automatically places early exit classifiers (EECs) in backbone networks from a Once-For-All (OFA) supernet to build EENN candidates. 
- EEC placement accounts for computational complexity using a defined cost.
- It uses novel regularizations in EENN training - one to enforce the MAC constraint, another to improve accuracy by aligning EEC confidences to operating points.
- A new figure of merit handles the MAC constraint adaptively during NAS search.

Contributions:
The key contributions are:
1) A NAS solution for joint backbone and EEC design of EENNs under hardware constraints. 
2) Automated EEC placement based on computational complexity.
3) Regularization terms to improve efficiency and accuracy of EENNs.
4) An adaptive figure of merit to handle constraints during NAS search.

Experiments show NACHOS finds compact EENNs competitive with state-of-the-art expert-designed networks on CIFAR-10, CINIC-10 and SVHN datasets. Ablation studies demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed regularizations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

NACHOS is a neural architecture search framework to automatically design early exit neural networks satisfying constraints on accuracy and computational complexity by jointly optimizing the backbone network and early exit classifiers through novel regularizations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) A novel NAS framework called NACHOS that can automatically design early exit neural networks (EENNs) satisfying constraints on accuracy and number of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. 

2) Automatic placement of early exit classifiers (EECs) along the backbone network while accounting for their computational complexity.

3) Introduction of two novel regularization terms in the EENN training loss: one to enforce the constraint on number of MAC operations, and another to align the confidences of the EECs with their accuracy.

4) A new figure of merit called $F_{CM}$ that handles the constraint on number of MAC operations in an adaptive way during the NAS search process.

In summary, NACHOS is the first NAS solution that can perform joint optimization of the EENN backbone network and placement of EECs while satisfying hardware constraints on computational complexity. The introduced regularization terms and adaptive constraint handling technique help optimize accuracy under the hardware constraints.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Neural Architecture Search (NAS) - Searching for optimal neural network architectures by automating the design process. A core focus of the paper.

- Early Exit Neural Networks (EENNs) - Neural networks with multiple early exit points, allowing predictions to be made before passing through the full network. The paper aims to optimize these using NAS. 

- Hardware Constraints - Constraints related to hardware, such as limits on number of operations (MACs) that can be performed. The paper enforces a constraint on MAC operations during NAS.

- Once-For-All Networks (OFA) - A type of "supernet" that encompasses many subnetwork architectures. Used as the search space for NAS in this paper.

- Pareto Optimality - Finding solutions that optimally trade off multiple objectives, such as accuracy vs. efficiency. The NAS framework tries to find Pareto optimal EENN architectures.

- Regularization - Regularization terms added to the training loss to encourage desired properties. Novel regularizations are introduced to improve EENN training.

- Surrogate Models - Models used to predict performance in order to avoid costly training of networks. Employed to guide the search and select architectures in the NAS framework.
