# [The Expert Knowledge combined with AI outperforms AI Alone in Seizure   Onset Zone Localization using resting state fMRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09360)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Accurate localization of seizure onset zones (SOZ) is critical for surgical treatment of refractory epilepsy, but relies on invasive intracranial EEG. 
- Non-invasive resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has shown promise for guiding SOZ localization, but manual analysis by experts is time-consuming, subjective, and not easily replicable. 
- Prior automation attempts using only machine learning have shown poor accuracy and precision for SOZ localization.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop an approach that integrates deep learning with expert knowledge for automated SOZ localization from rs-fMRI. 
- Use a 2D CNN for noise detection and an expert knowledge integration model for SOZ identification.
- Expert knowledge is encoded into spatial features like number of clusters, white matter overlap and temporal features like frequency domain sparsity.
- Linearly combine expert features using an optimization that maximizes discrimination between RSN and SOZ.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrated that integrating expert knowledge with deep learning improves SOZ localization accuracy to 84.8%, compared to less than 50% for deep learning alone.  
- Validated approach on a dataset of 52 pediatric refractory epilepsy patients across different age groups and surgical outcomes.
- Identified activation patterns originating in gray matter, extending through white matter to ventricles as most discriminative SOZ characteristic.
- Proposed approach has potential to enhance presurgical screening workflows and provide explanations for SOZ localization.

In summary, the key innovation is in merging experiential domain knowledge of characteristics of SOZ with the pattern recognition capabilities of deep learning to achieve a robust SOZ localization technique that outperforms existing methods.
