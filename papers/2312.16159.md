# [Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Reranking with Large Language Models for   Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16159)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for document reranking tasks, but their effectiveness for low-resource languages is not well studied. 
- Specifically, it's unclear how well LLMs perform cross-lingual reranking between English and African languages compared to monolingual reranking scenarios.

Methodology:
- Use 3 LLMs - RankGPT4, RankGPT3.5, and open-source RankZephyr for listwise reranking experiments.  
- Test on CIRAL benchmark with English queries and passages in 4 African languages.
- Compare cross-lingual reranking, monolingual reranking with document translation to English, and monolingual reranking with LLM-generated query translations.

Key Findings:
- Reranking is most effective when done fully in English using document translations. Up to 9 pt higher NDCG than reranking natively in African languages.
- Cross-lingual reranking is competitive depending on LLM's multilinguality. RankGPT4 does well likely due to better multilingual capabilities.
- RankGPT4 reranking improves when using its own translations vs Google translations, indicating correspondence between translation quality and ranking accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive evaluation of modern LLMs for cross-lingual and monolingual low-resource language reranking.
- Analysis of impact of using LLM's own translations on downstream ranking performance.
- Demonstrates capabilities of LLMs for low-resource IR, but significant room for improvement remains compared to English.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates the effectiveness of large language models as zero-shot cross-lingual rerankers for low-resource African languages, comparing proprietary and open-source models across translation and no-translation scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is an extensive investigation and analysis of the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) as zero-shot listwise rerankers for low-resource African languages. Specifically:

- The paper examines the effectiveness of proprietary (RankGPT) and open-source (RankZephyr) LLMs for cross-lingual and monolingual reranking across 4 African languages using the CIRAL benchmark.

- It compares the effectiveness of cross-lingual reranking (English queries, African language passages) to monolingual reranking using both document translation and query translation.

- It analyzes the impact of using the LLMs' own generated translations on the effectiveness of reranking fully in the African languages. 

- The results demonstrate that while reranking is most effective fully in English, cross-lingual reranking can be competitive depending on the multilingual capability of the LLM. The paper also shows the growing potential of open-source models for low-resource languages.

In summary, the main contribution is a thorough analysis of LLMs for low-resource cross-lingual retrieval grounded in an realistic CLIR scenario over multiple languages.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Zero-shot reranking
- Listwise reranking 
- Low-resource languages
- African languages (Hausa, Somali, Swahili, Yoruba)
- Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR)
- Query translation
- Document translation
- RankGPT models (RankGPT4, RankGPT3.5)
- RankZephyr
- BM25 retriever
- Translation quality
- Effectiveness in English vs low-resource languages

The paper examines the effectiveness of LLMs as zero-shot listwise rerankers in CLIR scenarios involving English and several low-resource African languages. It compares cross-lingual reranking to monolingual reranking using query/document translation. The proprietary RankGPT models and open-source RankZephyr are evaluated and translation quality is analyzed as a factor influencing reranking performance. So those are some of the key concepts and terminology related to this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper examines listwise reranking approaches. What are the key advantages of listwise reranking over pointwise and pairwise approaches when using large language models?

2. The prompt design used for listwise reranking is adapted from RankGPT. What modifications were made to the prompt and why were these changes necessary? 

3. The paper evaluates both proprietary (RankGPT) and open-source (RankZephyr) large language models. What differences were observed between these models in terms of cross-lingual and monolingual reranking effectiveness?

4. When translating queries, the authors examine using translations from the reranking language model itself vs. using Google Machine Translation. What differences were observed and what factors may contribute to these differences?

5. For the query translation scenario, scores are obtained by fusing results across multiple translation iterations. What fusion technique is used and why is this helpful when generating multiple translations?

6. When evaluating the language model's own translations, the authors use BLEU against human translations. What differences were observed between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 translation quality? How might this impact reranking effectiveness?

7. The best reranking effectiveness is achieved by translating documents rather than queries. Why might document translation be more effective than query translation for enabling language models to leverage their strength in English?

8. The paper examines both cross-lingual scenarios (English queries, African language passages) and monolingual African language scenarios. What differences were observed in terms of relative effectiveness? What factors contribute to these differences?

9. Both nDCG and MRR metrics are reported in the results. What trends were consistent across both metrics and what differences were observed between the metrics? 

10. The authors use retrieval based on BM25 for candidate generation. How might effectiveness change if a dense retriever was used instead? What are the tradeoffs to consider?
