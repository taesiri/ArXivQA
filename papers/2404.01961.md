# [Team UTSA-NLP at SemEval 2024 Task 5: Prompt Ensembling for Argument   Reasoning in Civil Procedures with GPT4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01961)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper focuses on the SemEval 2024 Task 5 - Legal Argument Reasoning in Civil Procedure. This requires a system to determine if an answer to a question is valid given some terse context about a legal case. 
- Mastering legal reasoning is an important skill for law students and developing AI systems that can logically reason over domain-specific information is a key research challenge.

Proposed Method:  
- The paper proposes a prompt-based solution using the large language model GPT-4.
- They use an ensemble with different prompting strategies like chain-of-thought reasoning and in-context learning with retrieved relevant examples to improve performance.

Main Contributions:
- Evaluated prompting strategies combining in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4. 
- An ensemble approach that combines predictions from different prompting variants. 
- Analysis of error types, finding cases where parts of answers were correct but reasoning was wrong lead to false positives with their approach.

Outcome:
- They achieved a Macro F1 score of 0.8095 on the validation set and 0.7315 (5th place out of 21 teams) on the final competition test set.
- The code for their system is available on GitHub.
