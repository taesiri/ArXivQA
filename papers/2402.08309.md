# [Prompted Contextual Vectors for Spear-Phishing Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08309)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Spear-phishing attacks are a major security threat, using targeted emails to steal sensitive information. Large language models (LLMs) are making this threat worse by automating the creation of persuasive spear-phishing emails and gathering detailed background information on targets. New detection methods are needed.

Solution:
- The authors propose a novel document vectorization method that leverages an ensemble of LLMs. By prompting the LLMs to reason about the email content and answer questions, they produce "prompted contextual document vectors" that quantify the presence of persuasion techniques and phishing indicators.

- They crafted 7 questions related to common persuasion tactics and phishing red flags. Each LLM outputs a probability in response to each question about an email. These probabilities are concatenated into a vector representing that email.

- Using an ensemble of diverse LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini) makes the method more robust. The vectors serve as input to a supervised ML model for phishing detection.

Contributions:
- A new explainable document vectorization technique using LLM reasoning to create prompted contextual vectors. Shows promise for text classification tasks, especially on adversarial problems like phishing.

- Introduction and release of a dataset of 333 high-quality, LLM-generated spear-phishing emails. Enables further research on detecting this new threat.

- Demonstrated 96% recall in detecting spear-phishing emails using their method, even when only traditional phishing emails were in the training set. Significantly outperformed other document vectorization techniques.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative way to leverage LLMs to create interpretable email representations that capture deception signals. This shows initial effectiveness on a challenging spear-phishing detection task using a new dataset.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel document vectorization method that utilizes an ensemble of large language models prompted with human-crafted questions to quantify the presence of persuasion techniques and other phishing indicators in emails, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting sophisticated, large language model-generated spear-phishing emails.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It presents a novel document vectorization technique that leverages large language models' (LLMs) reasoning capabilities to produce "prompted contextual document vectors". While this technique is used for spear-phishing detection in the paper, it could also be useful for other document classification tasks, especially in adversarial settings. 

2. It introduces and publishes a unique dataset of high-quality spear-phishing emails generated by the authors' LLM-powered proprietary system. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no other publicly available dataset of this type.

3. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the prompted contextual document vectorization method in detecting the spear-phishing emails generated by the system, even when they are not included in the machine learning classifier's training set. The proposed vectors significantly outperform other state-of-the-art document vectorization methods on this challenging task.

In summary, the key contribution is a new way of vectorizing text documents that leverages LLMs' reasoning and contextual understanding abilities, rather than just their language modeling capabilities. This allows the detection of more subtle signals in adversarial settings like spear-phishing.

The paper introduces a novel document vectorization method that leverages an ensemble of LLMs to create "prompted contextual vectors" for emails. These vectors capture the presence of common persuasion principles used in phishing attacks by prompting the LLMs to reason about questions related to those principles. The vectors are then used as input to a machine learning model for spear-phishing detection. The method is evaluated on a dataset of high-quality, LLM-generated spear-phishing emails. Key aspects of the work include the novel vectorization technique, the use of an LLM ensemble, the crafting of questions based on persuasion principles, and the application to spear-phishing detection with a focus on explainability and concept drift.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "prompted contextual document vectors." What are the key properties of these vectors compared to traditional document embedding methods? How do they aim to capture malicious intent or common persuasion techniques used in phishing emails?

2. The paper utilizes an ensemble of large language models (LLMs) to generate the prompted contextual document vectors instead of relying on a single LLM. What is the rationale behind using an ensemble? How does it aim to improve the robustness of the vectorization process?  

3. The paper manually crafts questions for the LLMs to reason about based on common persuasion principles and tactics used in phishing campaigns. What process was used to identify and formulate these questions? How can this process be automated or improved in the future?

4. The visualization using t-SNE shows clear separation between spear-phishing emails and benign emails when using the prompted contextual vectors. However, this distinction is less clear with a pretrained embedding method like DistilBERT. What does this suggest about the properties captured by the different vectorization techniques?

5. In the spear-phishing detection experiment, what explains the superior performance of the relatively older DistilBERT mean token vectors compared to more advanced document embedding techniques? How do the objectives behind fine-tuning impact performance on this adversarial task?

6. The error analysis highlights some pitfalls in LLM reasoning regarding suspicious links and sense of urgency. How can the ensemble approach help overcome these issues? What refinement strategies are suggested to improve classification of challenging cases?  

7. What are some key limitations of the proposed vectorization method, especially regarding computational requirements and the manual effort involved? How can these be addressed in future work?

8. The spear-phishing emails used for evaluation were generated by a proprietary system. Would the results hold if tested on a dataset of human-generated spear-phishing emails? What adaptations might be required?

9. The paper focuses on a binary classification framing of the problem. Could the prompted contextual vectors be effective in a multi-class attribution framework matching emails to specific campaigns? What changes would be required?

10. The technique shows promise for spear-phishing detection. What other document classification tasks, especially in adversarial settings like fraud or anomaly detection, could benefit from prompted contextual vectors? Why?
