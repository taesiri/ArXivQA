# [Prompted Contextual Vectors for Spear-Phishing Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08309)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Spear-phishing attacks are a major security threat, using targeted emails to steal sensitive information. Large language models (LLMs) are making this threat worse by automating the creation of persuasive spear-phishing emails and gathering detailed background information on targets. New detection methods are needed.

Solution:
- The authors propose a novel document vectorization method that leverages an ensemble of LLMs. By prompting the LLMs to reason about the email content and answer questions, they produce "prompted contextual document vectors" that quantify the presence of persuasion techniques and phishing indicators.

- They crafted 7 questions related to common persuasion tactics and phishing red flags. Each LLM outputs a probability in response to each question about an email. These probabilities are concatenated into a vector representing that email.

- Using an ensemble of diverse LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini) makes the method more robust. The vectors serve as input to a supervised ML model for phishing detection.

Contributions:
- A new explainable document vectorization technique using LLM reasoning to create prompted contextual vectors. Shows promise for text classification tasks, especially on adversarial problems like phishing.

- Introduction and release of a dataset of 333 high-quality, LLM-generated spear-phishing emails. Enables further research on detecting this new threat.

- Demonstrated 96% recall in detecting spear-phishing emails using their method, even when only traditional phishing emails were in the training set. Significantly outperformed other document vectorization techniques.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative way to leverage LLMs to create interpretable email representations that capture deception signals. This shows initial effectiveness on a challenging spear-phishing detection task using a new dataset.
