# [Identifying Planetary Names in Astronomy Papers: A Multi-Step Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08579)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Identifying mentions of planetary surface features like craters, dorsa, and lacus in astronomy literature is challenging due to significant lexical ambiguity. 
- Many feature names overlap with common words, personal names, locations, or other entities they are named after.  
- Identical names are shared across different celestial bodies, requiring disambiguation based on context.
- Standard named entity recognition (NER) models struggle to disambiguate these names using only local context within a sentence.

Proposed Solution:
- A multi-step pipeline is developed combining rule-based filtering, statistical relevance analysis, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, NER model filtering, hybrid keyword extraction, knowledge graph matching, paper relevance scoring, and interaction with a large language model (LLM).

Key Stages of Pipeline:
1. Candidate retrieval - Search astronomy papers to retrieve potential feature names. Customized rules filter out irrelevant candidates.

2. Statistical relevance analysis - Calculate probability scores indicating which celestial body feature names likely refer to based on contextual keyword frequencies.

3. POS tagging - Identify if names are used as adjectives to filter out irrelevant matches.  

4. NER model filtering - Use AstroBERT NER to categorize names and eliminate false positives.

5. Hybrid keyword extraction - Extract keywords from text around names using multiple techniques to determine relevant context.  

6. Knowledge graph matching - Create separate graphs for planetary and non-planetary context around names. Compare keyword sets to determine probability that name refers to a planetary surface.

7. Paper relevance scoring - Weigh paper characteristics like publishing venue and terminology usage to estimate likelihood that valid planetary names appear in text.

8. LLM validation - Provide context to language model to judge whether names refer to planetary surfaces.

Main Contributions:
- A robust methodology to overcome limitations of standard NER models when extracting extremely ambiguous entities in astronomy literature.

- A hybrid pipeline uniquely combining complementary NLP, NER, knowledge graphs and neural techniques to enable comprehensive disambiguation.

- State-of-the-art performance, achieving F1 score over 0.97 in disambiguating planetary feature names despite lexical ambiguity.

- A flexible design allowing integration of new features and techniques to further improve coverage and accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a multi-step pipeline to identify mentions of challenging planetary surface feature names like craters, dorsa, and lacus in astronomy literature by combining rule-based search, NLP analysis, statistical relevance scoring, knowledge graph matching, and querying a large language model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the development of a multi-step pipeline to identify mentions of planetary surface feature names (such as craters, dorsa, and lacus) in astronomy publications. The pipeline combines rule-based filtering, statistical relevance analysis, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, keyword extraction, knowledge graph matching, paper relevance scoring, and querying a large language model to disambiguate feature names that are ambiguous or used in multiple contexts. A key innovation is using contextual clues from both the local excerpt and global document to determine if a feature name refers specifically to a planetary surface or not. When evaluated on a dataset of astronomy papers, this methodology achieved a high F1-score over 0.97 in extracting and labeling valid planetary feature names, despite significant lexical ambiguity posing challenges. The hybrid approach and comprehensive contextual analysis enable more accurate identification of these domain entities than standard models.

The paper discusses challenges in automatically identifying names of planetary surface features like craters, dorsa, and lacus in astronomy literature, due to the ambiguity of feature names that overlap with common words or names of people/places. It presents a multi-step pipeline to address these challenges, combining various NLP, ML, and contextual analysis techniques for disambiguating and extracting these entities. The hybrid approach aims to overcome limitations of standard named entity recognition models when applied in isolation to this domain.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper for identifying planetary names in astronomy texts:

1. The paper proposes a multi-step pipeline combining several techniques. What are the key components of this pipeline and what role does each technique play in the disambiguation process? 

2. One component of the pipeline is a keyword analysis to determine relevance of a particular celestial body based on the text. How exactly does this contextual analysis technique work to calculate probabilities and decide whether to keep or discard a record?

3. The paper utilizes an AstroBERT NER model in one of the pipeline stages. What specifically does this model contribute in terms of filtering capabilities? What are some examples of false positives that it is able to eliminate?

4. Hybrid keyword harvesting is used to extract descriptive terms from text excerpts. What are the three methods used for keyword extraction and how do they complement each other? 

5. Explain in detail how the knowledge graph scoring works. How are the graphs constructed and what information do they encode to facilitate disambiguation of feature names? 

6. What criteria are used to calculate the paper relevance score? Why is this global contextual signal necessary in addition to the local excerpt-based analysis?

7. How is the large language model Orca Mini leveraged in this pipeline? What prompts are provided to it and what does its prediction score signify?

8. At the end, a support vector machine model predicts the final label and confidence value. What inputs does this model use to make its predictions?

9. The paper mentions enhancements like clustering sparse excerpts and expanding the KG to improve coverage of lesser known entities. How would these methods help address some of the limitations?

10. A key emphasis is on high recall to minimize overlooking any potential entities. What techniques enable such comprehensive name extraction despite the challenges?
