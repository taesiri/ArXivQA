# [Video-based Surgical Skill Assessment using Tree-based Gaussian Process   Classifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10208)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Surgical skill assessment is important for certifying surgeons and providing feedback to improve their skills. Manual assessment is time-consuming and subjective. Existing automated methods rely on complex neural networks that require large datasets or sensors to collect kinematic data, which is impractical. There is a need for an accurate and efficient automated surgical skill assessment method that works with limited video data.

Methods:
The paper proposes a pipeline called RF-NIGP-Tree that performs automated surgical skill assessment using video data. The pipeline has two main components:

1. Representation Flow (RF) Neural Network: Extracts spatial-temporal features from video frames efficiently. It is computationally simpler than two-stream networks used in prior works.

2. Noisy Input Gaussian Process Tree (NIGP-Tree): A novel tree-based Gaussian Process classifier robust to noise. It builds a tree where each node performs binary classification. Two new kernels, 30RBF and Powered-RBF, are introduced to improve accuracy.  

The RF network and NIGP-Tree are trained separately. NIGP-Tree takes sequences of RF feature maps as input. This allows it to work with limited training data.

Experiments:
The pipeline is evaluated on the JIGSAWS dataset containing videos of suturing, knot-tying and needle-passing tasks. It achieves 99% average accuracy outperforming prior works, with fewer video frames for training and testing. The new kernels also improve all variants of the GP classifier.

Conclusion:
The proposed RF-NIGP-Tree pipeline enables accurate and efficient surgical skill assessment using short video clips, without relying on kinematic data or complex neural networks requiring extensive data. The high accuracy and computational efficiency make it suitable for skill certification and targeted feedback for surgeons.
