# [A Quantitative Evaluation of Score Distillation Sampling Based   Text-to-3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18780)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-3D generation has made progress using score distillation sampling (SDS) with pre-trained text-to-image models, but suffers from issues like the Janus problem (repeating/missing object parts), text-3D misalignment, and lack of realism. 
- Existing methods rely on qualitative assessment of a few samples and lack systematic quantitative evaluation.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose quantitative evaluation metrics - frequency of Janus problem, text-3D alignment (human rating and CLIP R-precision), and realism (FID and IS)
- Analyze SDS framework and identify causes of artifacts like Janus problem
- Propose efficient two-stage text-to-3D baseline using Gaussian splatting and joint refinement with MVDream (multiview diffusion) and Stable Diffusion

Key Contributions:
- Thorough evaluation protocol and metrics to assess Janus problem, text-3D alignment, and realism
- Analysis and insights into artifacts of SDS framework for text-to-3D
- Strong baseline method that is 2x more efficient than others and achieves state-of-the-art on proposed metrics
- Demonstrate effectiveness of metrics by showing baseline outperforms existing methods on Janus problem, alignment and realism

The paper introduces an evaluation protocol to systematically and quantitatively assess text-to-3D methods. It also provides analysis into issues with current approaches, and proposes a efficient baseline that achieves better performance on the proposed metrics compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
