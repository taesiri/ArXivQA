# [Visually Grounded Language Learning: a review of language games,   datasets, tasks, and models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02431)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review and analysis of visually grounded language learning tasks, datasets, and models. The authors categorize tasks into three types of "language games" - discriminative, generative, and interactive. Discriminative tasks involve selecting an option from candidates, generative tasks produce language sequences, and interactive tasks require embodied agents to take actions and communicate in natural language. After systematically analyzing nearly 50 datasets, the authors argue interactive games are most important for future work because they enable agents to develop grounded meanings through physical experience and dialogue. They also survey over 50 recent models, assessing criteria like compositionality, dialogue skills, architecture design, visual representations, reasoning abilities, concept representation techniques, few-shot learning potential, use of real-world vision and natural language. Key weaknesses found include lack of real-world vision or natural language complexity, limited generalization abilities, and inability to support full conversations. The authors conclude by proposing perceptual symbol systems, increased multimodal robustness to missing/noisy data, and interactive environments with communicative agents as promising research directions for learning grounded language and developing artificial general intelligence.
