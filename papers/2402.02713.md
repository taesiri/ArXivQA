## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Time series analysis is crucial for understanding complex real-world systems and applications across diverse fields. However, most existing time series models rely heavily on domain knowledge and tuning, focusing narrowly on prediction tasks.  
- The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) with extensive knowledge and reasoning capabilities presents new opportunities to revolutionize time series analysis towards more general analytical intelligence. However, the integration of time series analysis with LLMs remains an underexplored area.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper argues that LLMs have untapped potential to profoundly impact time series analysis in 3 key ways:
   1) As effective data and model enhancers, augmenting data/models with enhanced knowledge and analytical prowess
   2) As superior predictors, utilizing their knowledge and reasoning for diverse prediction tasks  
   3) As next-generation agents, actively engaging in and transforming time series analysis
- The paper reviews relevant literature and outlines formulations for LLM-centric time series analysis to bridge gaps between the two fields.  

Main Contributions:
- Offers new perspectives on the potential of LLMs as the central hub for advancing time series analysis, advocating increased research focus in this area
- Provides a systematic categorization and clear roadmap highlighting 3 potential integration forms of LLMs with time series analysis
- Identifies limitations of current research and outlines promising future opportunities for investigations in this evolving interdisciplinary field

The paper aims to reshape viewpoints within the time series research community regarding the untapped potential of LLMs. It contributes academic discourse and directions while emphasizing the responsible and transparent use of LLMs towards enhancing analytical intelligence.
