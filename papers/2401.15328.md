# [Equipping Language Models with Tool Use Capability for Tabular Data   Analysis in Finance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15328)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown reasoning capabilities but still face challenges with error propagation and hallucination, especially in specialized domains like finance where data is heterogeneous and precision is important. 
- There has been limited research on augmenting LLMs with external tools to mitigate these limitations and offload certain reasoning steps.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose equipping an LLM (\textsc{Llama 2 13B Chat}) with tool use capabilities using parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).  
- The model acts as both a "task router" to dynamically direct questions to either be answered internally by the LLM or externally via tools, and a "task solver" to actually answer the question using the optimal approach.
- The tools used are a calculator and a lightweight SQL engine. Training data includes financial QA datasets along with automatic generation of examples showing tool use.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate potential for tool augmentation of LLMs specifically in the finance domain, which has seen little prior work.
- Show that a smaller LLM can be effectively equipped with tool use and outperform larger models like GPT-3.5.
- Introduce a "task router + task solver" framework where the model learns to dynamically select the optimal approach (tools vs. internal reasoning) per question.
- Report significant gains over base LLM, including 4x improvement on WikiSQL and competing with GPT-3.5 despite much smaller size.

The key innovation is enabling an LLM to leverage both its own reasoning and specialized external tools in a dynamic way to play to the strengths of each. This improves accuracy in specialized domains where precision matters.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes equipping language models with external tools to improve performance on financial question answering, demonstrating significant gains over the base model and competitive results with GPT-3.5.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is developing a model called Raven that augments a large language model (Llama 2 13B chat) with external tools to improve its reasoning capabilities, specifically for answering questions that require numerical or structured data reasoning. Key aspects of Raven include:

- It acts as both a "task router" to determine whether to answer a question internally or use a tool, and a "task solver" to actually generate the answer using the best approach.

- It is equipped with a calculator and a lightweight SQL engine as the external tools.

- It is trained via parameter-efficient fine-tuning on a mixture of financial domain and question answering datasets. 

- Compared to the base Llama model, Raven demonstrates significant gains in accuracy on financial QA datasets, improving by 35.2% on average. It also outperforms GPT-3.5 despite being much smaller.

- The authors show the value of tool augmentation for multi-hop reasoning over structured data, with Raven achieving things like a 4x improvement on WikiSQL compared to the base model.

So in summary, Raven advances tool augmented LLMs, showing strong results on financial QA through selective incorporation of specialized external tools.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes equipping language models with tool use capability for tabular data analysis. What are the main advantages and potential limitations of this approach compared to relying solely on the language model's inherent reasoning abilities?

2. The paper uses a Llama 2 13B Chat model as the backbone. What considerations went into choosing this specific model architecture and size? How might using an even larger language model impact performance?

3. The paper employs Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to equip the model with tool use. Why was this method chosen over other fine-tuning approaches? What are the tradeoffs? 

4. The model is equipped with a calculator and a lightweight SQL engine. Why were these specific tools chosen? What other tools could potentially be useful for financial domain question answering?

5. The paper uses a diverse mix of 4 datasets for training. What was the rationale behind choosing these specific datasets? How does diversity in the training data impact model performance?

6. The trained model employs a two-step inference process with a Task Router and Task Solver. Explain the purpose and function of each component. How does this dynamically steer questions to the optimal solver?

7. Analyze the significant performance gains on WikiSQL demonstrated in the paper. Why does tool augmentation provide such a marked benefit for reasoning over structured data?  

8. The model underperforms on the OTT-QA dataset. Speculate on the potential reasons. How could the approach be enhanced to better handle multi-hop reasoning in the absence of intermediate steps?

9. Critically evaluate the backoff mechanism employed when tool use fails. What are other methods to make the system more robust to failure cases? 

10. The paper demonstrates a lift over GPT-3.5 despite using a much smaller model. Analyze the probable factors that enable the tool-augmented model to outperform the foundation model. What are the most impactful components?
