# [Improving Algorithm-Selection and Performance-Prediction via Learning   Discriminating Training Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05359)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Algorithm selection models typically use handcrafted features to train a model to predict the best algorithm for a problem instance. However, features don't always correlate well with algorithm performance and can be expensive to compute. 
- Recent work has shown promise in using short algorithm trajectories (recording fitness over time) to train models instead of features. But trajectories may not discriminate well between algorithms and don't scale as you need trajectories from all algorithms in the portfolio.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a "meta" approach to generate discriminating trajectories to train algorithm selection models. 
- They use the irace configurator to tune a simple Simulated Annealing algorithm to produce short trajectories that maximize the performance of models trained on this data. 
- So rather than use trajectories from all algorithms in the portfolio, they generate customized trajectories tuned to train good models.

Contributions:
- Show trajectory-based models outperform landscape features for both classification and regression tasks using significantly less budget. 
- Tuned SA trajectories provide similar/better performance compared to models trained on trajectories from all solvers in portfolio but with far lower cost.
- Tuned trajectories consistently outperform models trained on raw solver trajectories in portfolio.
- Show potential for transfer learning - model tuned for one solver's trajectories can be reused for other solvers with minimal loss in performance.

In summary, the paper proposes a meta-approach for generating low-cost, customized and highly discriminating trajectories to train algorithm selection models which outperforms standard approaches based on landscape features or algorithm trajectories.
