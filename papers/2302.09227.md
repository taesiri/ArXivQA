# [Invertible Neural Skinning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09227)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper introduces a new method called Invertible Neural Skinning (INS) for animating humans in 3D using raw scans and poses. 

The key research question it aims to address is:

How can we build an animatable 3D representation of clothed humans that overcomes the limitations of prior methods like:

- Limited expressivity of Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) for modeling complex cloth and tissue deformations

- Requirement of expensive per-pose mesh extraction during animation 

- Lack of surface correspondences across different poses

The main hypothesis is that by incorporating Pose-conditioned Invertible Networks (PINs) around an LBS formulation, the authors can create an expressive and invertible pipeline to achieve fast animation of clothed humans while maintaining surface correspondences across poses.

The key contributions are:

1) Proposing a Pose-conditioned Invertible Network (PIN) architecture that learns additional pose-varying deformations to extend LBS.

2) Combining PINs with a differentiable LBS module into an end-to-end Invertible Neural Skinning (INS) pipeline.

3) Demonstrating INS outperforms prior state-of-the-art on clothed humans, while being an order of magnitude faster at reposing and preserving correspondences.

4) Performing ablations to analyze the usefulness of different components of INS.

In summary, the paper introduces INS to address limitations of prior works in animating clothed humans from raw scan data. The main hypothesis is that using pose-conditioned invertible networks around LBS can lead to an expressive, fast, and topology-preserving reposing approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing Invertible Neural Skinning (INS), a method for building animatable 3D representations of clothed humans from raw 3D scans. The key aspects of INS are:

- It uses Pose-conditioned Invertible Networks (PINs) to capture complex non-linear deformations of clothing and skin across different poses. This addresses limitations of standard Linear Blend Skinning (LBS).

- By placing PINs around a differentiable LBS module and using a pose-free canonical representation, INS allows animating the 3D representation while maintaining surface correspondences across poses. This avoids having to extract a separate mesh for each new pose.

- It demonstrates strong performance on reposing clothed humans, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods like SNARF while being an order of magnitude faster.

- The ablation studies show the benefits of the proposed pose-conditioning formulation and that INS can effectively correct artifacts introduced by standard LBS.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting INS as an expressive, efficient, and correspondence-preserving method for animating 3D representations of clothed humans learned from raw scan data. The use of invertible networks and pose-conditioning allows it to overcome limitations of previous approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an Invertible Neural Skinning method that uses Pose-conditioned Invertible Networks around a differentiable Linear Blend Skinning module to create an end-to-end pipeline for reposing clothed humans that outperforms prior methods, preserves correspondences across poses, and is an order of magnitude faster.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of animating 3D human representations:

- The main contribution is proposing an invertible neural network framework (INS) for reposing implicit human representations. This is novel compared to prior work like SNARF, NASA, NERFies which rely solely on Linear Blend Skinning and do not use invertible networks. 

- A key benefit of the INS framework is that it can maintain surface correspondences across poses, while also capturing complex non-linear deformations. Other recent works like SNARF use pose-conditioned representations but sacrifice correspondences and require costly per-frame mesh extraction.

- The paper shows strong quantitative results on clothed humans from the CAPE dataset, outperforming SNARF by around 1% in IoU. This highlights the capabilities of INS for modeling complex cloth deformations. On simpler minimally clothed DFAUST dataset, INS is competitive with SNARF.

- The paper ablates design choices like the pose-conditioning formulation, which is shown to be important. The visualizations also highlight INS's ability to alleviate LBS artifacts and represent details like wrinkles.

- Compared to concurrent work like IMAvatar, INS relies on optimization over learned smooth invertible mappings rather than predicting vertex offsets with MLPs. The comparisons suggest this leads to more natural deformations.

- For future work, the paper discusses removing the differentiable LBS module by learning from data and using more expressive canonical representations that can be trained on images. Both are interesting directions being explored in the field currently.

Overall, the proposed INS framework seems to advance the state-of-the-art for reposing of clothed humans by effectively utilizing invertible networks. The results demonstrate the potential of this technique compared to reliance solely on Linear Blend Skinning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the speed/efficiency of the reposing method. The correspondence search using the differentiable LBS module is a bottleneck during training. The authors suggest exploring ways to eliminate this module completely by learning its behavior directly from data.

- Replacing the occupancy network representation with one that can handle texture and lighting. This would allow learning directly from 2D images/videos rather than 3D scans.

- Exploring other potential applications of the proposed invertible neural network architecture like modeling physics-based deformations, animating characters with extreme poses, handling topological changes, etc. 

- Evaluating the approach on a more diverse and challenging dataset of clothed humans beyond CAPE to better stress test its capabilities.

- Combining the benefits of the proposed method with more classical computer graphics and simulation techniques for modeling clothes and human bodies.

- Extending the approach to model soft-tissue and facial animation which require preserving correspondences across poses.

- Exploring conditional inverse design, where pose and shape are predicted from a desired canonical surface representation.

- Applying the ideas beyond human body modeling to other articulated objects like animals.

In summary, the main future directions relate to improving efficiency, replacing the 3D representation with an image/video-based one, evaluating on more diverse data, combining with traditional CG methods, and extending the applications to related problem domains.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Invertible Neural Skinning (INS), an end-to-end differentiable method for animating implicit 3D human representations while preserving surface correspondences across poses. Previous methods for reposing human models suffer from the limited expressiveness of Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) and lose correspondences when extracting meshes separately for each pose. To address this, INS proposes a Pose-conditioned Invertible Network (PIN) architecture that extends LBS by learning additional non-linear pose-varying deformations. PINs are placed around a differentiable LBS module to create an expressive and invertible INS pipeline. By using a pose-free canonical representation, INS performs expensive mesh extraction only once and then simply reposes the mesh via inverse passes through the network. Experiments show INS outperforms state-of-the-art methods on reposing clothed humans while being an order of magnitude faster. Ablations demonstrate the benefits of the proposed pose conditioning formulation and that INS can alleviate LBS artefacts effectively.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new method called Invertible Neural Skinning (INS) for creating animatable 3D human models from raw 3D scans and poses. Existing methods using Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) are limited in their ability to represent complex clothing and pose deformations. Methods that use pose-conditioned canonical representations require slow per-pose mesh extraction and lose surface correspondences across poses. 

To address these issues, INS uses Pose-conditioned Invertible Networks (PINs) around an LBS module to learn additional pose-specific deformations while preserving correspondences. A pose-free canonical occupancy network allows one-time mesh extraction. The method outperforms state-of-the-art on clothed humans while being an order of magnitude faster at reposing sequences. The experiments demonstrate INS can represent finer surface details and correct LBS artifacts well. The pose-conditioning formulation and canonical space PIN are shown to be important components. The method is also competitive on minimally clothed humans. Overall, INS provides an expressive and efficient solution for animating scanned humans.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces an Invertible Neural Skinning (INS) method for animating 3D human representations from raw scans and poses. INS uses two Pose-conditioned Invertible Networks (PINs) placed around a differentiable Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) module. The first PIN operates after the canonical space and before LBS, while the second PIN operates after LBS and before the deformed space. These PINs help capture complex non-linear deformations across poses like cloth wrinkles, while also preserving exact correspondences between the canonical and deformed representations. For training, deformed points are mapped to the canonical space through an invertible skinning process involving the two PINs and differentiable LBS. A pose-free canonical occupancy network represents the subject. Mesh extraction is only needed once on this network. Then at inference, the pre-extracted mesh can be quickly reposed to novel poses by passing it through the learned skinning pipeline inversely. This allows bypassing expensive mesh extraction for each new pose.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper titled "Invertible Neural Skinning" is addressing the problem of animating and posing human 3D representations in novel poses beyond the original training data (a process called reposing). Specifically, it focuses on addressing some key limitations in prior work:

- Limited expressiveness of Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) in capturing complex pose-varying deformations like loose clothing and muscle bulges. 

- Requirement of costly mesh extraction from the 3D representation for each new pose, which becomes a bottleneck when animating at high frame rates.

- Loss of surface correspondences (topology preservation) across different poses of the same subject as a consequence of extracting separate meshes per pose.

The main question the paper seeks to address is: How can we build an animatable human representation that allows fast and detailed reposing to novel poses, while preserving correspondences?

To summarize, the key limitations this paper tries to address are:

- Limited expressiveness of LBS for modeling complex deformations
- Slow per-pose mesh extraction requirement 
- Lack of correspondence (topology preservation) across poses

And the main question is how to achieve fast, detailed, and correspondence-preserving reposing of human 3D representations.

- Linear blend skinning (LBS) - A traditional technique for posing and animating characters by blending bone transforms. The paper uses a differentiable version of LBS.

- Reposing/reposing - Generating novel poses for a character beyond the original training data. This is the core task tackled in the paper. 

- Invertible neural networks (INNs) - Bijective neural networks that can learn complex mappings while preserving exact correspondences between input and output. The paper uses INNs for reposing.
