# [SceneTrilogy: On Human Scene-Sketch and its Complementarity with Photo   and Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11964)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we learn a flexible joint embedding for scene understanding that fully supports the "optionality" brought by the complementary information across sketch, photo, and text modalities?

More specifically, the paper focuses on learning an embedding that provides:

1) Optionality across modalities - enables using any combination of modalities (e.g. only sketch, only text, or both sketch+text) as query for downstream tasks like retrieval.

2) Optionality across tasks - supports utilizing the embedding for both discriminative (e.g. retrieval) and generative (e.g. captioning) tasks. 

To achieve this, the paper proposes:

- Disentangling each modality into a modality-specific and a shared modality-agnostic component. The modality-agnostic components are aligned across modalities.

- Modeling the interaction between modality-agnostic components of sketch and text using a cross-attention mechanism. This allows flexibly combining sketch, text, or both as queries.

- Using the modality-agnostic components for retrieval, and combining them with modality-specific components for generative tasks like captioning.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that disentangling and flexibly combining information across modalities in this way enables a joint embedding that provides "optionality" in how sketch, photo, and text are utilized for diverse scene understanding tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the use of human scene sketches and exploring its complementarity with photos and text for multi-modal scene understanding. The key ideas are:

- Extending scene understanding to include human scene sketches, forming a complete "trilogy" of modalities - sketch, photo, and text.

- Conducting pilot studies showing sketch vs text tradeoffs for retrieval and subjective captioning tasks. This motivates combining sketch, photo, and text for multi-modal scene understanding. 

- Proposing a flexible joint embedding to support "optionality" across modalities (use any combinations as query) and tasks (retrieval and captioning). This is enabled by disentangling modality-specific and modality-agnostic components.

- Modeling the interaction between sketch, photo, and text modality-agnostic components using modified cross-attention and pooling. This allows flexible fusion of the three modalities.

- The unified embedding, once learned, supports various downstream tasks like retrieval, captioning, and subjective captioning without task-specific modifications.

In summary, the key contribution is exploring sketch and its complementarity with photo/text for multi-modal scene understanding via a flexible embedding, and demonstrating its effectiveness on various tasks. The inclusion of sketch brings new capabilities and understanding of human scene perception.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes SceneTrilogy, a method to learn joint embeddings of scene sketches, photos, and text. The key ideas are:

1) Disentangle modality-specific and modality-agnostic components from each modality. 

2) Align the modality-agnostic components across modalities using contrastive learning.

3) Use the aligned agnostic representations for cross-modal retrieval tasks. 

4) Generate modality-specific components from agnostic ones for generation tasks like captioning.

5) Optionality across modalities and tasks via the disentangled representations.

In summary, the paper presents a flexible framework to align scene sketches, photos and text in a shared space that supports both discriminative and generative downstream tasks with optionality across modalities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research:

- This paper focuses on learning joint embeddings for scene-level sketch, photo, and text modalities. Most prior work has focused on pairing just two of these modalities, such as sketch-photo, text-photo, or sketch-text. Extending to all three modalities is novel.

- The goal of providing "optionality" across modalities and tasks is unique. Most multi-modal embedding models are designed for a specific task like retrieval or generation. This model aims to support both in a flexible way.

- The proposed disentangled representation separating modality-specific and modality-agnostic factors is a key contribution. Other works have not focused on explicitly disentangling these factors for scene-level data across multiple modalities.

- The use of information bottleneck and conditional invertible networks for disentangling is technically novel compared to prior disentangling approaches.

- Evaluating on a diverse set of tasks (retrieval, captioning, subjective captioning) is more comprehensive than most prior work. Most focus only on one task.

- The model architecture and training process seem simple and reproducible compared to some recent complex models like CLIP. But results are quite competitive.

Overall, I would say the main novelties are the focus on joint modeling of scene sketch, photo, and text together, with flexible "optionality", enabled by a disentangled representation using modern deep learning techniques. The comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks is also a strength.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the paper suggest some future research directions:

- Exploring challenging downstream tasks such as scene-level sketch-based image generation, sketch and text based image generation, and text-based sketch generation tasks. These generative tasks could build on the joint embedding space learned in this work.

- Extending the model to support optionality across even more modalities beyond sketch, text, and photo. For example, adding sound or video. This could further improve the flexibility and expressiveness of the multimodal representation.

- Studying how different types of sketches (abstract, realistic, cartoon, etc.) might complement each other and text/photo in the joint embedding space. This could reveal new insights into human visual communication. 

- Evaluating the approach on additional datasets beyond SketchyCOCO and FSCOCO used in the current work. More diverse datasets could better validate the generalizability.

- Developing extensions and applications of the flexible joint embedding space, such as for visual search, image editing, human-computer interaction, etc. The optionality enabled by the model opens up many possibilities.

- Exploring how the disentanglement into modality-specific and agnostic components could be useful for other cross-modal tasks like style transfer or domain adaptation.

Overall, the main future direction is leveraging the proposed model's capabilities for new multimodal applications and research problems. Both expanding the scope of modalities and tasks could be promising next steps.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper extends scene understanding to include human sketch, forming a trilogy of scene representation from sketch, photo, and text modalities. Rather than rigidly embedding the three modalities, the authors focus on a flexible joint embedding to leverage their complementarity. The embedding supports "optionality" across modalities, allowing use of any combination as a query for downstream tasks like retrieval, and across tasks, enabling both discriminative (e.g. retrieval) and generative (e.g. captioning) applications. The modalities are disentangled into modality-specific and modality-agnostic components using information bottleneck and conditional invertible neural networks. The modality-agnostic components are aligned via a modified cross-attention. Once learned, this embedding enables various scene-related tasks including sketch-based image retrieval, text-based retrieval, sketch+text based retrieval, image/sketch captioning, and subjective captioning using sketch guidance, all without task-specific modifications. The complementarity of sketch, photo, and text is leveraged through this flexibility and optionality of the joint embedding space.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method for learning a joint embedding space across three modalities - sketch, photo, and text - for scene understanding. The key idea is to disentangle the representations from each modality into a modality-agnostic component that captures shared semantics, and a modality-specific component that holds information only relevant for that modality. This allows combining the modalities in a flexible way to support both discriminative tasks like cross-modal retrieval, and generative tasks like image/sketch captioning. 

Specifically, the modality-agnostic components are aligned using a contrastive loss, while the modality-specific components are modeled using conditional invertible neural networks. This enables optionally using sketch, text, or both as a query for retrieval, as well as generating captions conditioned on sketch, photo, or both. Experiments on scene sketch datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on tasks including sketch-based image retrieval, text-based image retrieval, sketch+text based image retrieval, and subjective sketch-guided image captioning. The key advantage is providing flexibility in how the modalities are combined while eliminating irrelevant modality-specific factors.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method used in this paper is a flexible joint embedding to represent scenes using sketch, photo, and text modalities. The key ideas are:

1) Disentangle the representations from each modality into a modality-agnostic component that contains shared semantic information, and a modality-specific component with details unique to that modality. This is done using an information bottleneck approach to maximize mutual information between the agnostic components, while minimizing it between agnostic and specific. 

2) Align the modality-agnostic components using a modified cross-attention mechanism. This allows flexibly combining sketch, text, and photo in any permutation as a query for retrieval tasks. 

3) The modality-specific components are modeled using conditional invertible neural networks. Sampling from these during inference supports generating the target modality, enabling captioning tasks.

4) Once learned, the embedding supports a range of discriminative (e.g. retrieval) and generative (e.g. captioning) tasks without task-specific modifications. It allows flexibly using sketch, text, photo in any combination as a query or conditional input.

In summary, the key contribution is a flexible joint embedding with "optionality" across modalities and tasks. It brings together the strengths of sketch, photo, and text to represent and reason about scenes.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of extending scene understanding to include human scene sketches. The key question is how to learn a flexible joint embedding of sketch, photo, and text modalities that supports "optionality" across modalities and tasks. 

In particular, the paper aims to:

- Integrate human scene sketches into multi-modal scene understanding, alongside photos and text. This completes a "trilogy" of diverse yet complementary modalities for representing scenes.

- Learn an embedding that supports optionality across modalities - allowing the use of sketch, text, or both as queries for downstream tasks like retrieval.

- Enable optionality across tasks - so the embedding can support both discriminative (e.g. retrieval) and generative (e.g. captioning) tasks without modifications.

- Model the complementarity between sketch, text, and photos - so users can leverage the strengths of each modality as needed. For example, sketch for spatial relationships, text for colors, photos for textures.

- Support new sketch-based tasks like sketch retrieval, sketch captioning, and subjective image captioning guided by sketch.

In summary, the key focus is developing a flexible joint embedding to fully exploit the complementarity of sketch, text, and photos for scene understanding. This allows optimal use of modalities and supports both retrieval and generation tasks.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called SceneTrilogy that extends scene understanding to include human scene sketches, completing a trilogy of scene representations from three diverse and complementary modalities - sketch, photo, and text. The key insight is that instead of learning a rigid three-way embedding, a flexible joint embedding is proposed that supports "optionality" across modalities and tasks. Specifically, sketch, photo, and text are disentangled into modality-agnostic and modality-specific components using information bottleneck and conditional invertible neural networks. The modality-agnostic components are aligned using a modified cross-attention mechanism. This disentangled embedding enables optionality across modalities, allowing use of any combinations like sketch, text, or both as query for downstream retrieval tasks. It also enables optionality across tasks by supporting both discriminative (e.g. retrieval) and generative (e.g. captioning) tasks without modifications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on retrieval tasks like SBIR, TBIR, STBIR and generative tasks like image, sketch, and subjective captioning. Ablations validate the contributions of the proposed disentanglement and fusion strategies. SceneTrilogy provides new insights into multi-modal scene understanding by highlighting the complementarity of sketch, photo, and text.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes the SceneTrilogy framework for multi-modal scene understanding using sketch, photo, and text. The goal is to learn a flexible joint embedding that supports optionality across modalities (use any combinations of sketch, photo, text as query) and across tasks (support both discriminative like retrieval and generative like captioning). To achieve this, they disentangle the representations from each modality into a modality-agnostic part that captures shared semantics and a modality-specific part with details like style. The modality-agnostic parts are aligned using contrastive loss. For tasks like retrieval, the modality-agnostic features are used. For generation like captioning, the framework combines the modality-agnostic from the source with modality-specific of the target. Once learned, this embedding supports downstream tasks like sketch-based image retrieval, text-based retrieval, sketch+text retrieval, image/sketch captioning and subjective captioning. Experiments on SketchyCOCO and FS-COCO datasets demonstrate the benefits of the proposed flexible embedding for multi-modal scene understanding.
