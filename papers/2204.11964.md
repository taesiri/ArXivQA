# [SceneTrilogy: On Human Scene-Sketch and its Complementarity with Photo   and Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11964)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we learn a flexible joint embedding for scene understanding that fully supports the "optionality" brought by the complementary information across sketch, photo, and text modalities?

More specifically, the paper focuses on learning an embedding that provides:

1) Optionality across modalities - enables using any combination of modalities (e.g. only sketch, only text, or both sketch+text) as query for downstream tasks like retrieval.

2) Optionality across tasks - supports utilizing the embedding for both discriminative (e.g. retrieval) and generative (e.g. captioning) tasks. 

To achieve this, the paper proposes:

- Disentangling each modality into a modality-specific and a shared modality-agnostic component. The modality-agnostic components are aligned across modalities.

- Modeling the interaction between modality-agnostic components of sketch and text using a cross-attention mechanism. This allows flexibly combining sketch, text, or both as queries.

- Using the modality-agnostic components for retrieval, and combining them with modality-specific components for generative tasks like captioning.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that disentangling and flexibly combining information across modalities in this way enables a joint embedding that provides "optionality" in how sketch, photo, and text are utilized for diverse scene understanding tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the use of human scene sketches and exploring its complementarity with photos and text for multi-modal scene understanding. The key ideas are:

- Extending scene understanding to include human scene sketches, forming a complete "trilogy" of modalities - sketch, photo, and text.

- Conducting pilot studies showing sketch vs text tradeoffs for retrieval and subjective captioning tasks. This motivates combining sketch, photo, and text for multi-modal scene understanding. 

- Proposing a flexible joint embedding to support "optionality" across modalities (use any combinations as query) and tasks (retrieval and captioning). This is enabled by disentangling modality-specific and modality-agnostic components.

- Modeling the interaction between sketch, photo, and text modality-agnostic components using modified cross-attention and pooling. This allows flexible fusion of the three modalities.

- The unified embedding, once learned, supports various downstream tasks like retrieval, captioning, and subjective captioning without task-specific modifications.

In summary, the key contribution is exploring sketch and its complementarity with photo/text for multi-modal scene understanding via a flexible embedding, and demonstrating its effectiveness on various tasks. The inclusion of sketch brings new capabilities and understanding of human scene perception.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes SceneTrilogy, a method to learn joint embeddings of scene sketches, photos, and text. The key ideas are:

1) Disentangle modality-specific and modality-agnostic components from each modality. 

2) Align the modality-agnostic components across modalities using contrastive learning.

3) Use the aligned agnostic representations for cross-modal retrieval tasks. 

4) Generate modality-specific components from agnostic ones for generation tasks like captioning.

5) Optionality across modalities and tasks via the disentangled representations.

In summary, the paper presents a flexible framework to align scene sketches, photos and text in a shared space that supports both discriminative and generative downstream tasks with optionality across modalities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research:

- This paper focuses on learning joint embeddings for scene-level sketch, photo, and text modalities. Most prior work has focused on pairing just two of these modalities, such as sketch-photo, text-photo, or sketch-text. Extending to all three modalities is novel.

- The goal of providing "optionality" across modalities and tasks is unique. Most multi-modal embedding models are designed for a specific task like retrieval or generation. This model aims to support both in a flexible way.

- The proposed disentangled representation separating modality-specific and modality-agnostic factors is a key contribution. Other works have not focused on explicitly disentangling these factors for scene-level data across multiple modalities.

- The use of information bottleneck and conditional invertible networks for disentangling is technically novel compared to prior disentangling approaches.

- Evaluating on a diverse set of tasks (retrieval, captioning, subjective captioning) is more comprehensive than most prior work. Most focus only on one task.

- The model architecture and training process seem simple and reproducible compared to some recent complex models like CLIP. But results are quite competitive.

Overall, I would say the main novelties are the focus on joint modeling of scene sketch, photo, and text together, with flexible "optionality", enabled by a disentangled representation using modern deep learning techniques. The comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks is also a strength.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the paper suggest some future research directions:

- Exploring challenging downstream tasks such as scene-level sketch-based image generation, sketch and text based image generation, and text-based sketch generation tasks. These generative tasks could build on the joint embedding space learned in this work.

- Extending the model to support optionality across even more modalities beyond sketch, text, and photo. For example, adding sound or video. This could further improve the flexibility and expressiveness of the multimodal representation.

- Studying how different types of sketches (abstract, realistic, cartoon, etc.) might complement each other and text/photo in the joint embedding space. This could reveal new insights into human visual communication. 

- Evaluating the approach on additional datasets beyond SketchyCOCO and FSCOCO used in the current work. More diverse datasets could better validate the generalizability.

- Developing extensions and applications of the flexible joint embedding space, such as for visual search, image editing, human-computer interaction, etc. The optionality enabled by the model opens up many possibilities.

- Exploring how the disentanglement into modality-specific and agnostic components could be useful for other cross-modal tasks like style transfer or domain adaptation.

Overall, the main future direction is leveraging the proposed model's capabilities for new multimodal applications and research problems. Both expanding the scope of modalities and tasks could be promising next steps.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper extends scene understanding to include human sketch, forming a trilogy of scene representation from sketch, photo, and text modalities. Rather than rigidly embedding the three modalities, the authors focus on a flexible joint embedding to leverage their complementarity. The embedding supports "optionality" across modalities, allowing use of any combination as a query for downstream tasks like retrieval, and across tasks, enabling both discriminative (e.g. retrieval) and generative (e.g. captioning) applications. The modalities are disentangled into modality-specific and modality-agnostic components using information bottleneck and conditional invertible neural networks. The modality-agnostic components are aligned via a modified cross-attention. Once learned, this embedding enables various scene-related tasks including sketch-based image retrieval, text-based retrieval, sketch+text based retrieval, image/sketch captioning, and subjective captioning using sketch guidance, all without task-specific modifications. The complementarity of sketch, photo, and text is leveraged through this flexibility and optionality of the joint embedding space.
