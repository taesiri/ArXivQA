# [Motion Flow Matching for Human Motion Synthesis and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08895)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new generative model called Motion Flow Matching for efficient and high-quality human motion synthesis. The model is based on the recently introduced flow matching technique that uses vector field regression with a neural ODE solver to generate samples along straight trajectories, avoiding issues with curvature that are present in diffusion models. The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art results on text-to-motion and action-to-motion datasets, with faster sampling requiring only 10 steps (versus 1000+ for diffusion models) and better FID scores. A novel training-free editing paradigm called sampling trajectory rewriting is also introduced that enables intuitive editing of motions for tasks like motion prediction, in-between frames, and upper body manipulation by aligning known motion segments with straight trajectory paths during generation. Both quantitatively and qualitatively, this editing approach also exceeds a baseline diffusion model. Overall, the work presents compelling advantages of using flow matching in the motion generation domain to enhance sampling efficiency as well as enable direct editing operations in a simple way.
