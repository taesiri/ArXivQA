# [Style Transfer to Calvin and Hobbes comics using Stable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03993)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper describes the use of stable diffusion fine-tuning to perform comic style transfer on images to match the style of Calvin and Hobbes. The authors created a dataset of over 11,000 comic panels extracted from PDFs of Calvin and Hobbes volumes. They fine-tuned the stable diffusion model using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which allows efficient adaptation of the model to new datasets. Experiments included text-to-image generation, image-to-image transfer using original images and edge maps as inputs, and application to video frames. Results qualitatively demonstrated successful transfer to the Calvin and Hobbes style for images. However, video results showed temporal inconsistency. The authors discuss several areas for future improvement, including enhancing the dataset, exploring alternative training methods like DreamBooth, and generating full comic strips with language models. Through model fine-tuning guided by the nostalgic Calvin and Hobbes artwork, this project provides a solid foundation for further style transfer exploration.
