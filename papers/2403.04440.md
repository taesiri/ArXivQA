# [RoboKube: Establishing a New Foundation for the Cloud Native Evolution   in Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04440)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Cloud native technologies like containers and Kubernetes are expanding into IoT and cyber-physical systems including robotics, but the integration of ROS applications into cloud-native environments is still at an early stage. 
- There is a lack of comprehensive methodology to guide the transition of legacy ROS apps to Kubernetes in a way that leverages the benefits like simplicity, reliability and scalability.

Proposed Solution - RoboKube:
- An adaptive framework based on Kubernetes to set up a common orchestration platform across devices, edge and cloud for deploying cloudified ROS apps. 
- Addresses networking challenges to enable deployment in heterogeneous environments including wireless networks.
- Provides containerization strategies, guidelines on distributing and clustering ROS nodes, and deployment options using Helm charts.

Key Contributions:
- Reviews current cloudification practices for ROS in academia and industry.
- Explains how to set up RoboKube platform using K3s and multicast-enabled CNI plugins like Kube-ovn.
- Discusses considerations for containerizing ROS nodes, splitting nodes across containers, and dynamic distribution.
- Presents case study of teleoperation testbed deployed using RoboKube over WAN.
- Aims to accelerate cloud native evolution in robotics by providing an achievable solution for transitioning ROS apps to Kubernetes.

In summary, the paper proposes RoboKube, an adaptive Kubernetes-based framework to facilitate deployment of cloudified ROS applications across diverse environments. It offers insights into platform setup, containerization strategies and deployment options to guide the integration of robotics systems with cloud native technologies.
