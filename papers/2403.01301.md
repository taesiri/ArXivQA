# [Supplier Recommendation in Online Procurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01301)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Supply chain optimization through effective supplier selection is vital for businesses. Online procurement systems are increasingly used to run bidding events to contract suppliers. Selecting the right suppliers to invite is crucial.
- Supplier recommendation is challenging as recommendations must be made for new events, for which no historical interaction data is available (a cold-start problem).  

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate supplier recommendation for procurement events as a recommendation problem. Treat events as users, suppliers as items to recommend.
- Event meta-data (purchaser ID, text descriptions) and past event-supplier participation data is available. 
- Use a Factorization Machine algorithm that can leverage both meta-data and interaction data to make recommendations.
- Evaluate on a real-world dataset of road freight bidding events, with 7023 supplier interactions across 165 events.

Key Contributions:
- Novel formulation of supplier recommendation for online procurement as a recommendation problem.
- Demonstrate the potential of using Factorization Machines that exploit meta-data and interaction data.
- Preliminary experiments on real procurement data show proposed approach outperforms non-personalized and basic matrix factorization baselines.
- Identify data sparsity and cold-start scenarios as key challenges.
- Discuss potential enhancements - more meta-data, model finer supplier-requirement granularity with more data.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel supplier recommendation system for online procurement using Factorization Machines. Experiments demonstrate promising performance improvements over baselines. More data and refinements to the approach are identified as areas for future work.
