## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on scanning the content of the paper, I did not find any explicitly defined keywords or key terms. The paper appears to be a template for formatting conference proceedings in LaTeX, and does not contain substantive content or research. The closest thing to keywords are the ACM classifications and ACM concepts listed, but these seem to be filler content demonstrating how to format those elements, rather than representing the actual subject matter of this template paper. So in summary, there are no clear keywords or terms associated with the content itself.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the LaTeX paper template:

Problem:
The paper provides a LaTeX template named "acmart" for preparing academic articles formatted for ACM publication in journals or conference proceedings. The goal is to provide consistent styling across ACM publications and incorporate features like accessibility, metadata extraction, etc. needed for the ACM Digital Library. 

Solution: 
The template defines various template styles (acmsmall, acmlarge, acmconf) and parameters to format articles appropriately depending on whether it is a journal article, full conference paper, extended abstract, etc. It specifies the Libertine font family to be used across articles. The template provides commands for specifying critical article metadata like title, authors, rights information, ACM classification concepts, keywords, sections, figures, tables, equations, citations, acknowledgments and appendices. Specific examples and best practices for using these are covered in detail. Additional tips are provided for formatting elements like the abstract, teasers, accessibility of figures, acknowledgments section etc. Custom SIGCHI formats are also supported.

Contributions:
- Unified and consistent LaTeX template for all ACM publications
- Incorporates accessibility, metadata handling and other Digital Library features
- Supports multiple template styles and custom formats as needed
- Provides guidance and examples for article content authoring 
- Designed for ease of use by authors while enforcing ACM standards

In summary, the acmart LaTeX template aims to simplify and streamline authoring of academic articles for ACM publications by defining a robust and flexible template that promotes consistency. Detailed instructions and examples enable authors to effectively utilize its capabilities for writing high quality papers.
