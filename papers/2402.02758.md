# [Exploring the Effects of Shared Autonomy on Cognitive Load and Trust in   Human-Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02758)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In human-robot interaction (HRI), determining the appropriate level of robot autonomy to assist humans in performing tasks remains an open challenge. Specifically, how robot autonomy impacts the human user's cognitive load and trust in the robot is not well understood. 

- Prior works have studied the effects of autonomy on cognitive load or trust separately. However, evidence suggests these factors may interact. Therefore, it is important to analyze the three-way relationship between autonomy, cognitive load and trust.

Methodology:
- The authors conducted a user study (N=24) involving a teleoperation task with varying autonomy levels using a shared control scheme. 

- Participants teleoperated a robotic arm to track 3D trajectories (primary task), while concurrently tapping a rhythm from memory (secondary task) to induce cognitive load. 

- Cognitive load was measured via self-reports (NASA TLX), tapping performance, and pupil dilation. Trust was measured via capacity-based trust questionnaires (MDMT).

- The study tested 3 main hypotheses: (1) cognitive load decreases with increasing autonomy, (2) trust increases with increasing autonomy, (3) an autonomy-dependent relationship exists between trust and cognitive load.

Results:
- Autonomy level influenced subjective cognitive load (NASA TLX) and trust measures, but not the objective cognitive load metrics.

- No clear interaction found between autonomy, cognitive load and trust. The results suggest cognitive load and trust are distinct factors influenced independently by autonomy.

Conclusions:
- Determining appropriate cognitive load measures for HRI remains an open challenge.

- Trust questionnaires could effectively capture changes in trust with autonomy. However, further research needed on using single-scale trust measures.

- More fine-grained autonomy modulation needed to further analyze the intricate relationship between autonomy, cognitive load and trust.

Main Contributions:
- First study analyzing the three-way interaction between autonomy, cognitive load and trust.

- Provided insights into limitations around evaluating cognitive load in HRI settings. 

- Showed promise for using compact trust measures to develop adaptive shared autonomy systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a user study to investigate the effects of varying robot autonomy levels on the user's cognitive load and trust during a teleoperation task, finding that while higher autonomy reduced the subjectively reported cognitive load, there was no three-way interaction between autonomy, trust, and cognitive load.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an investigation into the relationships between robot autonomy level, the human user's cognitive load, and their trust in the robot during a human-robot interaction (HRI) task. Specifically, the authors conducted a user study with 24 participants who performed a robotic teleoperation task under different autonomy levels. Using subjective questionnaires and objective measures, the study analyzed how varying autonomy impacted the participants' perceived cognitive load and trust in the robot. The key findings were:

1) Increasing autonomy reduced the participants' self-reported cognitive load, supporting the hypothesis that autonomy assistance can lower perceived workload. However, objective cognitive load measures did not show the same clear effect.

2) Increasing autonomy improved participants' trust in the robot, measured via trust questionnaires. This suggests users were able to recognize the robot's superior capability under higher autonomy.

3) No clear interaction was found between cognitive load and trust based on autonomy level changes. This implies they may be independently influenced by autonomy.

Overall, the study highlights the need to consider both cognitive load and trust as important factors that can be impacted by adjusting robot autonomy in human-robot collaborative scenarios. The discrepancies between subjective and objective load measures also motivate future research to better understand these relationships for developing more effective shared-control robots.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this paper include:

- Human-robot interaction (HRI)
- Shared autonomy 
- Teleoperation
- Cognitive load
- Trust
- Autonomy level
- Trajectory tracking 
- Dual-task paradigm
- Physiological measures (pupil dilation)
- Subjective measures (questionnaires)
- Multi-Dimensional Measure of Trust (MDMT)
- NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)

The paper explores the relationships between a robot's autonomy level and a human user's cognitive load and trust during a teleoperation task. It employs both objective physiological measures and subjective questionnaires to quantify cognitive load and trust. The key goal is to understand if and how autonomy level influences these factors, and if there are any interactions between them, which is relevant for developing adaptive assistive robots.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The study used both objective (e.g. pupil dilation) and subjective (e.g. questionnaires) measures to evaluate cognitive load. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each type of measure? How could they be combined to get a more holistic understanding of cognitive load?

2. The rhythm method was used as a secondary task to assess cognitive load. What are other possible secondary tasks that could have been used? How might the choice of secondary task impact the results and interpretation related to cognitive load? 

3. The study evaluated trust using the MDMT questionnaire. What other questionnaires or measures could have been used to assess trust? What are the strengths and limitations of the different options?

4. The autonomous controller used a convex combination formulation for shared control. What other formulations or shared control schemes could have been implemented? How might those impact trust and cognitive load?

5. The study evaluated high and low autonomy conditions. Would using a more continuous range of autonomy levels give further insights into how autonomy impacts cognitive load and trust? What range would you suggest exploring?

6. The autonomous controller was designed to perform the task very accurately. How do you think results might change if the autonomous controller was less capable or made occasional mistakes?

7. What other interface design choices (e.g. different controllers, visualizations etc.) could impact the relationships observed between autonomy, trust and cognitive load?

8. The sample size was 24 people. Do you think a larger sample would lead to different results and conclusions? What sample size would you recommend for future studies?

9. The participants were mostly university students. How might results differ with a sample from other demographics? What participant groups would be useful to study?

10. The task involved trajectory tracking in a laboratory setting. How could the concepts be studied in other experimental paradigms or real-world scenarios? What applications would be most interesting or impactful to explore?
