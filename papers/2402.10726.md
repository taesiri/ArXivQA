# [Learning Planning Action Models from State Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10726)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior automated approaches to learning STRIPS action models require knowing the names and parameters of the actions to be learned in advance. Their task is then only to deduce preconditions and effects of those predefined actions.
- This is limiting as in many real-world cases we may not know the parameters of actions a priori. 

Proposed Solution:  
- Authors introduce two levels of state traces - L1 and L2 - with varying amounts of info about ground actions between states.
- L1 traces only have action names. L2 traces additionally have objects that are arguments to those actions.
- They propose an algorithm for learning action models from each trace type, creatively tackling the missing information.

Key Ideas and Contributions:
- With L1 traces, they initially guess the number of parameters per action using a novel lower bound calculation. They incrementally encode the remaining learning task into SAT for efficiency and flexibility.
- For L2 traces, they synthesize action schemas by first speculatively generating explanations for observed state transitions and pruning invalid ones later. They employ ideas like type inference and preferring minimal explanations.  
- The algorithms are evaluated on a large set of IPC benchmark domains. Results show they significantly outperform state-of-the-art method FAMA in scalability and quality of learned models.
- Main contributions are introducing the two trace types and corresponding novel techniques to learn action models without complete information about action parameters or arguments. This advances the automated acquisition of planning domains.

In summary, the paper makes important progress on the problem of learning STRIPS action models without full specification of actions, leveraging incremental SAT solving and other creative ideas. The results showcase improved scalability and accuracy over prior art.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents two new algorithms for learning STRIPS action models from state traces, without requiring prior information about action parameters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing two new algorithms (L1 and L2) for learning STRIPS action models from state traces that do not require information about the parameters of the actions to be learned. Specifically:

- The L1 algorithm works with traces where states are labeled only with action names. It needs to infer both the parameters and preconditions/effects of actions.

- The L2 algorithm works with traces where states additionally contain the objects that are parameters of the executed actions. It still needs to infer the types of parameters and preconditions/effects.

The paper shows experimentally that:

- The algorithms can handle more complex domains and larger input traces than the previous state-of-the-art method FAMA.

- The synthesized models are closer to original benchmark domains, especially for the L2 algorithm. 

So in summary, the key contribution is developing new algorithms for automated planning domain model acquisition that require less information as input but can still produce high quality models. This helps with the task of acquiring symbolic models for planning from real-world observations/logs.

The paper introduces two new algorithms (L1 and L2) for learning STRIPS action models from different levels of state traces, without requiring information about the parameters of the actions.

The algorithms are evaluated empirically on planning domains and benchmarks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces two levels of trace quality, L1 and L2. What is the key difference between L1 and L2 traces? What additional information does L2 provide over L1? 

2. The L2 algorithm works by generating sets of possible explanations to account for observed state transitions. How does it ensure these explanation sets are minimal and consistent across transitions?

3. When generating preconditions in the L2 algorithm, the paper states "We take all the ground facts in Sb whose only arguments are among o, lifted in all possible ways to r." Why is this a reasonable approach for identifying candidate preconditions?

4. The paper mentions limitations in precondition and type synthesis with the L2 algorithm on the IPC benchmarks. What were some of the specific reasons it over or under approximated preconditions and types in certain cases?

5. How does the L1 algorithm overcome the lack of action parameter information in the traces, in terms of determining the number of parameters and mapping them to objects?

6. Explain the high-level approach of using incremental SAT encoding and solving to synthesize action models from L1 traces. What triggers additions to the encoding?

7. The empirical evaluation shows the L2 algorithm has better performance than L1. Why does access to action parameters in the traces enable faster and higher quality learning?

8. For the largest and most complex domain, Agricola, the L2 algorithm still synthesized a model with remarkably few errors compared to the hundreds of preconditions. Why does the algorithm tend to overestimate preconditions, and why is this preferable to underestimating them?

9. The paper mentions developing an algorithm for L0 traces in future work. What would be the key challenges in learning action models from traces with no state or action labels? 

10. Aside from handling less informative traces, what other limitations of the current approach could be addressed in future work, such as supporting more expressive action representations?
