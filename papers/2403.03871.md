# [Decoupled Vertical Federated Learning for Practical Training on   Vertically Partitioned Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03871)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows collaborators with disjoint features of common data samples to jointly train a machine learning model without sharing data. However, it has some limitations:
    - Single point of failure: If any guest fails to communicate features or host fails to communicate gradients, training stops. 
    - Limited applicability: VFL requires a large intersection of samples among collaborators, which is often not feasible.
    - Privacy risks: Guests can potentially infer private information about other guests from the gradients they receive.

Proposed Solution: Decoupled Vertical Federated Learning (DVFL)
- Key idea: Completely decouple the training of guest feature extractors, host feature aggregators and the final label prediction model owned by the "owner". 
- Guests and hosts are trained greedily on separate unsupervised objectives without any feedback from hosts or labels. This allows asynchronous and fault-tolerant training.
- Final label prediction model is then trained on concatenated host representations. This transfer learning model can be trained on a separate labeled dataset.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces concept of decoupled training in VFL for enhanced fault tolerance and privacy.
- Allows flexibility of sample spaces across collaborators, with final model only requiring small labeled intersection. 
- Empirically demonstrates graceful performance degradation under various failure modes compared to VFL.
- Completely eliminates possibility of gradient-based inference attacks between collaborators.
- Can help expand applicability of collaborative learning to systems with unreliable devices and sparse intersections of data.

In summary, DVFL introduces useful engineering properties like asynchronicity, privacy and fault tolerance to enable collaborative learning in practical decentralized settings.
