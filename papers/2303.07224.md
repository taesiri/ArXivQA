# [Efficient Semantic Segmentation by Altering Resolutions for Compressed   Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07224)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we achieve efficient semantic segmentation for compressed videos by reducing computational cost while maintaining high accuracy? 

The key hypothesis is that by altering the input resolutions (using high resolution for keyframes and low resolution for non-keyframes) and aggregating features across resolutions, the computational cost of video semantic segmentation can be significantly reduced without compromising accuracy.

The paper proposes a new framework called AR-Seg to address this question. The key ideas are:

1) Use an HR branch to process keyframes at high resolution and an LR branch for non-keyframes at low resolution. This reduces computation for most frames.

2) Design a Cross Resolution Feature Fusion (CReFF) module to aggregate HR keyframe features into LR non-keyframe features, preventing loss of accuracy.

3) Propose a Feature Similarity Training (FST) strategy to supervise the LR branch to learn from the HR branch for better feature learning.

Through experiments on CamVid and Cityscapes datasets, the paper shows AR-Seg reduces computational cost by nearly 70% while maintaining high segmentation accuracy compared to constant resolution baselines. This supports their hypothesis that altering resolutions for compressed video segmentation can improve efficiency significantly without sacrificing performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an efficient framework called AR-Seg for video semantic segmentation of compressed videos. The key ideas are:

1. AR-Seg uses altering input resolutions - high resolution for keyframes and low resolution for non-keyframes - to reduce computational cost. This is a new perspective compared to prior work that focused on network architecture or propagation schemes. 

2. A Cross Resolution Feature Fusion (CReFF) module is designed to fuse features from the high resolution keyframes into the low resolution non-keyframes. This compensates for the loss of detail when downsampling non-keyframes.

3. A Feature Similarity Training (FST) strategy with explicit and implicit constraints is proposed to guide the learning of CReFF's fused features.

4. Experiments on CamVid and Cityscapes datasets show AR-Seg reduces computation by ~70% compared to constant resolution models, while maintaining high accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient video semantic segmentation framework that exploits altering resolutions in compressed video, along with associated techniques to maintain accuracy. This provides a new way to improve efficiency orthogonal to prior methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient semantic segmentation framework for compressed videos called AR-Seg that reduces computational cost by processing only keyframes at high resolution while using a novel cross resolution feature fusion module and training strategy to maintain segmentation accuracy for non-keyframes processed at lower resolution.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in efficient video semantic segmentation:

- The key idea of using altering input resolutions is novel compared to prior work. Most previous methods focus on altering the network architecture or feature propagation strategies. Changing the input resolution provides an orthogonal way to reduce computational cost.

- The proposed CReFF module is effective for fusing features across different resolutions. It aligns features spatially with motion vector warping, and uses attention to selectively aggregate information. This allows the low-resolution branch to leverage useful details from the high-resolution keyframes. 

- The feature similarity training (FST) strategy provides explicit and implicit constraints to supervise the learning of CReFF. The similarity loss and shared decoder layer help transfer knowledge from the reliable high-resolution branch to guide the low-resolution branch.

- Experiments demonstrate AR-Seg's versatility with different backbones and compatibility with various compression settings. The consistent gains over constant-resolution baselines highlight the benefits of the altering resolution idea.

- AR-Seg achieves better trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency compared to prior video segmentation methods. It reduces FLOPs by 55-70% with minimal or no drop in mIoU. Other approaches typically sacrifice more accuracy for less computation reduction.

- The idea of altering resolutions could potentially be applied to other dense prediction tasks on videos, like depth estimation or pose estimation. But architectural differences between segmentation and other tasks would need to be considered.

In summary, the altering resolution strategy and associated CReFF module for cross-resolution fusion are the unique contributions of this work. The design and evaluations demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods in efficient video semantic segmentation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring more complicated scheduling of multi-resolutions and keyframe gaps to further improve the video semantic segmentation performance. The current AR-Seg framework only uses two alternating resolutions (HR and LR) for keyframes and non-keyframes. Using more finely tuned scheduling of resolutions across frames could lead to better efficiency and accuracy trade-offs.

- Applying the idea of altering resolutions to other dense prediction video tasks like video object detection and tracking. The authors suggest the insight of leveraging temporal correlation to compensate for lower resolutions could be relevant for other video tasks beyond semantic segmentation.

- Evaluating AR-Seg on a wider range of backbone networks and datasets. The experiments in the paper demonstrate compatibility with PSPNet and BiseNet on two datasets, but testing on more network architectures and video datasets would further verify the generalizability.

- Exploring automated methods to determine the optimal keyframe intervals and resolutions based on video content, instead of using fixed GOP structures. Adaptively selecting keyframes and non-keyframe resolutions could maximize efficiency.

- Extending the framework to videos compressed by other standards besides HEVC, such as AOMedia, AVS3, VVC, etc. Showing robustness across different video codecs would strengthen the applicability.

- Testing the system in real-time applications and evaluating the end-to-end latency. The FPS results reported are promising for real-time usage but end-to-end measurements could validate that further.

In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding AR-Seg to handle more complex resolution scheduling, applying it to other tasks and datasets, integrating automated adaptation mechanisms, and deploying the system for real-time usage across different codecs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an efficient semantic segmentation framework for compressed videos called AR-Seg that reduces computational cost by processing frames at different resolutions. It uses a high resolution (HR) branch to process keyframes and a low resolution (LR) branch for non-keyframes. To prevent accuracy loss from downsampling non-keyframes, a Cross Resolution Feature Fusion (CReFF) module is proposed to enrich LR features using warped HR keyframe features and attention-based aggregation. A Feature Similarity Training (FST) strategy with explicit and implicit supervisions is also introduced to guide the learning of aggregated features.

The CReFF module and FST strategy are shown to be effective for compensating information loss in LR frames.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an altering resolution framework called AR-Seg for efficient video semantic segmentation of compressed videos. Traditional video segmentation approaches apply computationally expensive image segmentation networks frame-by-frame. AR-Seg reduces computational cost by using high resolution for sparse key frames and lower resolution for non-key frames. It has two branches - an HR branch for keyframes and an LR branch for non-keyframes. The key idea is to enrich the lower resolution frames with detail from the high resolution keyframes using a novel Cross Resolution Feature Fusion (CReFF) module. CReFF aligns and fuses features from the HR branch into the LR branch using motion vectors from the compressed video. This allows AR-Seg to maintain accuracy while significantly reducing computation. AR-Seg also uses a Feature Similarity Training (FST) strategy to supervise training of the LR branch using HR features as reference.

Experiments show AR-Seg reduces FLOPs by 67% with comparable accuracy to constant high resolution processing on the CamVid and Cityscapes datasets. It is compatible with different backbones like PSPNet and BiseNet. Ablations verify the importance of the CReFF and FST components. Overall, by altering input resolution and propagating HR details to LR frames, AR-Seg achieves efficient video semantic segmentation without sacrificing accuracy.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an efficient video semantic segmentation framework called AR-Seg that reduces computational cost by processing keyframes at high resolution and non-keyframes at low resolution. The key ideas are:

1) Use an HR branch to process keyframes and an LR branch for non-keyframes. Place a novel Cross Resolution Feature Fusion (CReFF) module in the LR branch to fuse features from the HR keyframes.

2) The CReFF module first warps the HR features to align with the LR features using motion vectors from compressed video. It then selectively aggregates the warped features into the LR features using a local attention mechanism. This enriches details in LR features. 

3) A Feature Similarity Training (FST) strategy is proposed to supervise the learning of aggregated features. FST contains an explicit similarity loss between aggregated and HR features, and an implicit constraint from the shared decoding layer.

4) Experiments show AR-Seg reduces FLOPs by ~70% while maintaining accuracy. It is compatible with different backbones and video compression configurations. The proposed CReFF and FST are key to preventing performance drop when reducing input resolution.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of efficiently performing video semantic segmentation. Some key points about the problem and proposed approach:

- Video semantic segmentation is computationally expensive due to needing to perform per-frame predictions at high frame rates. Existing methods have focused on efficient network architectures, but have not considered the impact of input resolution which directly affects computational cost.

- The paper proposes an "altering resolution framework" called AR-Seg that processes keyframes at high resolution to preserve details, and non-keyframes at low resolution to reduce computation. 

- To prevent accuracy loss from lower resolution inputs, the paper designs a Cross Resolution Feature Fusion (CReFF) module to enrich the low resolution frames with details from high resolution keyframes using motion information.

- A Feature Similarity Training (FST) strategy is also proposed to supervise and guide the learning of enriched low resolution features using the high resolution counterparts.

- Experiments on CamVid and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate AR-Seg reduces computational cost by ~70% compared to constant high resolution processing, while maintaining high accuracy by compensating for lower resolution inputs using CReFF and FST.

In summary, the key contribution is an efficient video segmentation framework that exploits altering resolutions across frames, along with methods to maintain accuracy when processing lower resolution frames by transferring details from high resolution references. This improves efficiency beyond prior work that only looked at network architecture.
