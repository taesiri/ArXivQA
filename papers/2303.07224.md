# [Efficient Semantic Segmentation by Altering Resolutions for Compressed   Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07224)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we achieve efficient semantic segmentation for compressed videos by reducing computational cost while maintaining high accuracy? The key hypothesis is that by altering the input resolutions (using high resolution for keyframes and low resolution for non-keyframes) and aggregating features across resolutions, the computational cost of video semantic segmentation can be significantly reduced without compromising accuracy.The paper proposes a new framework called AR-Seg to address this question. The key ideas are:1) Use an HR branch to process keyframes at high resolution and an LR branch for non-keyframes at low resolution. This reduces computation for most frames.2) Design a Cross Resolution Feature Fusion (CReFF) module to aggregate HR keyframe features into LR non-keyframe features, preventing loss of accuracy.3) Propose a Feature Similarity Training (FST) strategy to supervise the LR branch to learn from the HR branch for better feature learning.Through experiments on CamVid and Cityscapes datasets, the paper shows AR-Seg reduces computational cost by nearly 70% while maintaining high segmentation accuracy compared to constant resolution baselines. This supports their hypothesis that altering resolutions for compressed video segmentation can improve efficiency significantly without sacrificing performance.
