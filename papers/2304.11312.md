# [Lookahead Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Refining Mean Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11312)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: how to improve the estimation accuracy of the mean vectors in the sequence of conditional Gaussian distributions used in the backward process of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs)? 

The key idea proposed is to perform extrapolation on the two most recent estimates of the original data sample x obtained at consecutive timesteps. This allows the model to "look ahead" and obtain a more accurate estimate of x, thereby refining the mean estimation and leading to better sample quality.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that introducing an extrapolation operation between consecutive timestep estimates of x can improve the accuracy of the mean estimation in DPMs and enhance sample quality, especially when the number of timesteps is limited. The paper conducts experiments to validate this hypothesis on various DPM algorithms.
