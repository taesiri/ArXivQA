# [Dynamic LiDAR Re-simulation using Compositional Neural Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05247)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces DyNFL, a novel neural field approach for high-fidelity re-simulation of LiDAR scans in dynamic driving scenes. The method takes as input LiDAR measurements and tracked bounding boxes of moving objects. It represents the scene using a decomposed model consisting of a static background field and separate fields for each dynamic object. A key contribution is the neural field composition technique to integrate assets from various scenes. This involves a ray drop test to properly manage occlusions and transparent surfaces between fields. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate DyNFLâ€™s superior performance on tasks like view synthesis and editing compared to baselines. Quantitatively, it reduces errors in range, intensity, and object detection over methods like LiDARsim and UniSim. Qualitatively, DyNFL facilitates flexible editing by altering object trajectories or inserting/removing reconstructed objects across scenes. Limitations include challenges handling unseen object views and reliance on accurate object detections. But overall, DyNFL advances dynamic scene simulation from LiDAR scans through its combination of physical fidelity and editing flexibility.
