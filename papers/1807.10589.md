# [Diverse feature visualizations reveal invariances in early layers of   deep neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10589)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we systematically visualize and quantify the invariances learned in the representations of different layers of deep neural networks? 

In particular, the authors are interested in studying the invariances learned in the early and intermediate convolutional layers of CNNs trained on object recognition, and comparing these to known invariances like phase invariance in the early visual cortex. 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

- Even relatively early layers in CNNs trained on object recognition exhibit non-trivial forms of invariance, which are not revealed by standard feature visualization techniques like activity maximization.

- Different network architectures like VGG-19 and ResNet-50 learn substantially different invariances in their early layers, despite similar accuracy on object recognition tasks.

- Some units in early layers exhibit phase invariance similar to complex cells in the primary visual cortex, while others show invariance to local diffeomorphic transformations.

So in summary, the main goals are to develop systematic methods to visualize and quantify invariances in CNN representations, demonstrate interesting invariances exist in early layers, and reveal differences between network architectures - with connections to neuroscience.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors propose a method to systematically visualize and quantify invariances in the responses of hidden units in deep neural networks. Their approach involves optimizing batches of images to maximally activate a unit while also being as distinct from each other as possible. 

2. Applying this method, they find that even early convolutional layers in VGG-19 exhibit substantial invariance, of two main types:

- Texture detectors that are invariant to phase / location 
- Shape detectors that allow local diffeomorphic transformations

3. They show that these response invariances are a learned property of VGG-19, not just a result of the CNN architecture. Units are more invariant than in a network with the same architecture but random weights.

4. They compare VGG-19 to ResNet-50 trained on the same task and find ResNet has far fewer phase invariant units in early layers, revealing representational differences between these networks.

5. They provide quantitative metrics to measure the degree of phase invariance and tolerance to local deformations of units.

6. They demonstrate the approach on a CNN trained to predict V1 responses, recovering known cell types (simple and complex cells).

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a systematic method to visualize and quantify invariances learned by CNN units, and using this to uncover representational properties and differences between networks. This provides new insights into the computations performed by DNNs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper develops a method to systematically visualize the invariances learned by hidden units in convolutional neural networks, revealing two main types in early layers of VGG19 - invariance to local phase changes and to diffeomorphic transformations - and showing far less phase invariance in early layers of ResNet50, indicating architectural differences despite similar accuracies.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on visualizing features and invariances in deep neural networks:

- It proposes a new method to systematically map out the manifold of inputs that highly activate a unit, in order to uncover its invariances. Other recent work like Carter et al. (2019) has visualized multiple facets of neurons' selectivity, but relied more on random sampling rather than explicitly optimizing for diversity like this paper.

- The paper provides new insights into invariances present even in early convolutional layers of VGG19, including near-perfect phase invariance and invariance to local diffeomorphic transformations in different units. Other work has tended to focus on higher network layers when studying invariances.

- It offers a way to quantify different types of invariance (e.g. phase invariance and tolerance to local deformations). This helps systematically characterize units along a spectrum from texture-like to shape-like.

- The paper compares representations learned in VGG19 and ResNets, finding ResNet has far less phase invariance in early layers. This reveals architectural differences despite both models being trained on ImageNet. Most prior work has focused on a single network architecture.

- The method is demonstrated on a model trained to predict brain responses, recovering simple and complex cells. This showcases the utility for understanding biological neural networks compared to purely computational focus of most similar work.

Overall, this paper makes important contributions in terms of the methodology to systematically uncover invariances, the insights gained into invariances learned by CNNs, comparison between network architectures, and connections to neuroscience. The novel visualization approach allows asking new types of questions about representations learned by deep networks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Search for explicit parameterizations of the invariance transformations (e.g. phase, translation, rotation, etc.) in a similar way that a phase parameter describes the invariance of a complex cell. This could lead to more compact representations that require fewer parameters by offering good inductive biases.

- Investigate the role of skip connections and residual connections in invariance. They found less phase invariance in ResNet compared to VGG, likely due to the skip connections. Further study on how network architecture impacts learned invariances could provide useful insights.

- Apply their visualization methods to other network architectures beyond VGG and ResNet to gain a better understanding of how different architectures learn representations and invariances.

- Use their approach to visualize invariances in other domains beyond computer vision, such as speech recognition, natural language processing, etc. This could reveal interesting insights about the learned representations in those domains.

- Develop quantitative metrics beyond the two proposed here to characterize additional types of invariance that may emerge in neural networks.

- Extend the visualization methods to recurrent neural networks and transformers to understand the representations and invariances learned in sequence modeling tasks.

In summary, the main future directions are to further study the relationship between network architecture and learned invariances, apply the methods to additional domains and network architectures, develop more invariance metrics, and extend the approach to sequence models. Overall, their work provides a useful framework for gaining a deeper understanding of representations learned by neural networks.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method to discover invariances in the responses of hidden layer units in deep neural networks (DNNs). The approach involves simultaneously searching for a batch of images that strongly activate a unit while also being as distinct from each other as possible. The authors apply this technique to convolutional layers in VGG-19 and find units exhibiting invariance to transformations like phase shifts in periodic patterns and local diffeomorphic transformations. They also uncover differences compared to ResNet-50, with VGG-19 units showing more phase invariance, revealing representational differences between the networks. Overall, the paper introduces a systematic approach to study invariance transformations learned by DNNs, an important computational component.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a method to visualize the invariances learned by hidden units in deep neural networks (DNNs). Motivated by complex cells in the early visual system that are invariant to the phase of visual patterns, the authors develop an approach to find a diverse batch of images that activate a unit strongly while being as distinct as possible. They apply this technique to visualize units in the convolutional layers of VGG-19 trained on ImageNet classification. The visualizations reveal two main types of invariance learned even in early layers: 1) Texture detectors that are invariant to phase shifts of periodic patterns. 2) Shape detectors that are invariant to local diffeomorphic transformations that preserve coarse shape features. The authors quantify these two types of invariance and find they are prevalent but anticorrelated in the convolutional layers of VGG-19. Comparisons to a network with random weights show these invariances are learned properties. Interestingly, early layers of ResNet-50 exhibit far less phase invariance, revealing architectural differences in the features learned by the two networks. Overall, the work demonstrates that invariances are a key computation learned by DNNs and this technique offers a way to systematically study their emergence.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel feature visualization technique to uncover invariances learned by DNNs. It reveals phase invariance in early layers of VGG-19 and differences compared to ResNet-50, demonstrating these methods can provide new insights into the representations and computations of neural networks. The results also suggest invariance transformations are a major component of the function of even low-level units.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method to visualize the invariances in the responses of hidden layer units in deep neural networks (DNNs). The key idea is to simultaneously optimize a batch of images to strongly activate a given unit while also maximizing the diversity between the images. Specifically, the method optimizes an objective function with three terms: 1) maximizing the activation of the target unit for each image, 2) maximizing the likelihood of each image under a natural image prior, and 3) maximizing the minimum pairwise distance between images according to a feature space distance metric. This approach reveals the manifold of inputs that elicit strong responses from the unit, uncovering invariances beyond what is found by standard activity maximization techniques. The method is applied to visualize phase invariance in early convolutional layers of VGG-19 and differences compared to ResNet-50, as well as invariances of units predicting responses in primary visual cortex.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper is investigating the response invariances in early and intermediate layers of deep neural networks (DNNs). Many previous studies have focused on visualizing the selectivity of individual units, but less attention has been paid to characterizing the invariances they exhibit. 

- The authors are motivated by complex cells in the early visual system, which respond to visual patterns independently of their phase or precise location. They aim to develop methods to systematically characterize invariances in DNNs.

- They propose an approach to find a diverse set of images that activate a unit strongly, by optimizing for high activation while simultaneously maximizing diversity between images.

- Applying this to VGG-19, they find units in early layers exhibit invariance to transformations like phase shifts or local diffeomorphic warps. Some units act like "texture detectors" exhibiting phase invariance, while others act more like "shape detectors" allowing local deformations.

- They quantify and characterize these invariances across layers. Early layers show more phase invariance which decreases in higher layers. 

- Compared to VGG-19, early layers in ResNet-50 show far less phase invariance, revealing architectural differences.

- The methods help uncover and quantify invariances in DNNs, which are an important component of their computations. This is useful for understanding and comparing representations learned by different network architectures.

In summary, the key focus is on developing methods to systematically characterize invariances in early and intermediate layers of DNNs, whichreveal interesting properties and differences between network architectures.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a method to discover invariances in the responses of hidden layer units in deep neural networks (DNNs). Motivated by complex cells in the early visual system that exhibit phase invariance, the authors show that characterizing invariance is as important as characterizing selectivity for understanding units' computations. They develop an approach to map the manifold of highly-activating inputs for a given unit as exhaustively as possible. Specifically, they optimize a batch of images to strongly activate the unit while being as distinct from each other as possible. Applying this to VGG-19 convolutional layers reveals various forms of invariance in early layers, including near-perfect phase invariance in some units and invariance to local diffeomorphic transformations in others. Comparatively little invariance is found in early layers of ResNet-50, revealing representational differences between networks. The authors conclude that invariance transformations are a major computational component learned by DNNs, and their systematic method helps uncover them. The approach is also applied to a CNN predicting V1 responses, uncovering simple and complex cells. Overall, the study provides insights into computations performed in DNNs and biological vision, and offers a unified framework for describing representations in both.
