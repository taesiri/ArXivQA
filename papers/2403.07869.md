## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Lack of large-scale datasets is a key bottleneck limiting progress in imitation learning (IL) for mobile manipulation tasks. This is largely due to the lack of available and easy-to-use teleoperation interfaces.
- Existing teleoperation systems have tradeoffs between accuracy, availability, versatility, and expressiveness when controlling mobile manipulators. No single interface provides scalable and dexterous control.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose TeleMoMa, a novel general and modular teleoperation framework for whole-body control of mobile manipulators. 
- It enables combining multiple human interfaces (VR, vision, keyboard etc.) to leverage their complementary capabilities. This allows intuitive control of all degrees of freedom of a mobile robot.
- The system consists of three components: Human Interface, Teleoperation Channel, Robot Interface. The channel connects interfaces and handles action mapping and command consolidation.

Key Contributions:
- TeleMoMa allows scalable data collection for IL by providing an accessible and versatile teleoperation interface for mobile manipulators.
- It supports various robots (Tiago, Fetch, HSR) and environments (real, simulation).
- Experiments demonstrate TeleMoMa's modularity enables better user performance compared to individual interfaces. 
- IL policies trained on TeleMoMa data succeed in complex bimanual mobile manipulation tasks requiring coordinated mobility and manipulation.
- User studies and comparisons across embodiments and environments showcase TeleMoMa's generality and suitability for data collection.

In summary, the paper presents TeleMoMa, a novel modular framework for intuitive teleoperation of mobile manipulators using multiple human interfaces. Experiments and analysis demonstrate its versatility for scalable high-quality data collection to enable progress in imitation learning for mobile manipulation.

- TeleMoMa supports teleoperating different mobile manipulator platforms like PAL Tiago, Toyota HSR and Fetch robots in both simulation and the real world. It is a general and versatile system.

- The paper demonstrates TeleMoMa's capabilities through user studies showing benefits of modularity, imitation learning experiments showing it can collect high-quality demonstrations, remote teleoperation demonstrations, and comparisons showing similar performance in sim vs real and with different robots.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating TeleMoMa, a modular and versatile teleoperation system for mobile manipulators to facilitate scalable data collection for imitation learning. The modularity and task/robot versatility are key aspects that set it apart from prior work.
