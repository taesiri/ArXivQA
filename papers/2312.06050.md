# [Federated Multilinear Principal Component Analysis with Applications in   Prognostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06050)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Federated Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (FMPCA) method to enable multiple users to collaboratively perform tensor dimensionality reduction via MPCA while keeping each user's data private and confidential. The authors develop three federated learning algorithms tailored to replace the Preprocessing, Initialization, and Local Optimization steps in the traditional MPCA algorithm. Specifically, the Federated Centralization Algorithm allows secure computation of a global mean; the Federated Initialization Algorithm enables joint computation of the initial projection matrices; and the Federated Local Optimization Algorithm allows iterative updating of the projection matrices. Theoretical analysis proves the proposed FMPCA method achieves identical performance to applying MPCA on aggregated data from all users. As an application, the authors demonstrate FMPCA in an industrial prognostics task using imaging sensor data. Experiments on simulated and real-world rotating machinery data validate that FMPCA maintains the same accuracy as standard MPCA while protecting data privacy. The results also show federated learning leads to performance improvement compared to models trained on individual user data, confirming the benefits of collaboration.
