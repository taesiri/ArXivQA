# [Exploring Cluster Analysis in Nelore Cattle Visual Score Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07137)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Assessing beef cattle biotype through visual evaluation by humans is common in precision cattle breeding, but it can be subjective. 
- There is a need to find objective measurements that correlate with visual scores and body weight to improve cattle evaluation.

Methods:
- Collected data on 23 Nelore bulls, including body measurements from images, productivity metrics, and visual scores from 3 experts. 
- Investigated correlations between measurements, scores, and body weight.  
- Applied k-means clustering on measurements highly correlated with weight (dorsum area, croup width, dorsum length) and scores (croup width, body weight, croup height).

Results: 
- Strong correlations found between some measurements like dorsum area and body weight.
- But only weak correlations between visual scores and measurements, contradicting expectations.
- Dorsum view measurements clustered cattle effectively by body weight.  
- But structure score measurements did not achieve good clustering by score.

Conclusions:
- Issue with conceptualization or subjectivity of visual scoring not clear from data.  
- Dorsum view measurements could be useful for clustering cattle by body weight.
- More research needed on correlating visual evaluations to measurements and on using measurements for clustering.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis of correlation between body measurements and visual scores in Nelore cattle
- Demonstration of using measurements highly correlated with weight and scores for clustering
- Identification of issues with connecting visual evaluation to objective measures
- Providing direction for future research on cattle evaluation and clustering
