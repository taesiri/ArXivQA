# [Visual Geometry Grounded Deep Structure From Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04563)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Visual Geometry Grounded Deep Structure From Motion (\method), a new fully differentiable pipeline for structure from motion (SfM). \method simplifies traditional SfM pipelines by utilizing recent advances in deep 2D point tracking to directly extract reliable pixel-accurate correspondences across all input images. It then estimates all camera poses simultaneously using a Transformer network based on these tracks and image features. Next, a Transformer network triangulates an initial 3D point cloud. Finally, a differentiable bundle adjustment layer refines the reconstruction. Through end-to-end training, each component enhances subsequent stages. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on camera pose estimation and 3D triangulation. The accuracy and scalability advances come from the model simplicity and joint training enabled by the fully differentiable design. Qualitative results also showcase successful reconstructions on challenging in-the-wild photos. In summary, this work presents a simplified, fully differentiable SfM pipeline with strong empirical performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a fully differentiable structure-from-motion pipeline called Visual Geometry Grounded Deep Structure From Motion (VGGSfM) which trains end-to-end and achieves state-of-the-art performance by replacing traditional SfM components like incremental camera registration and bundle adjustment with learned counterparts based on transformers and differentiable optimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Visual Geometry Grounded Deep Structure From Motion (\method), which is a fully differentiable SfM pipeline that can be trained end-to-end. Specifically, the key contributions include:

1) A deep feed-forward tracking module that directly predicts point trajectories across images instead of relying on chaining pairwise matches. This simplifies correspondence estimation in traditional SfM pipelines.

2) Non-incremental camera and 3D point initialization with deep Transformer networks instead of incremental registration. This is simpler, fully differentiable, and performs joint estimation of all camera poses. 

3) A differentiable bundle adjustment layer based on the Theseus library for end-to-end refinement. 

4) State-of-the-art performance on camera pose estimation and 3D triangulation tasks across several datasets. The end-to-end training provides noticeable accuracy improvements over training components individually.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the first fully differentiable SfM pipeline that simplifies traditional SfM while achieving strong performance. The end-to-end trainability is a key advantage over prior works.
