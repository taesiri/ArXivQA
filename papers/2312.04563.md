# [Visual Geometry Grounded Deep Structure From Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04563)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Visual Geometry Grounded Deep Structure From Motion (\method), a new fully differentiable pipeline for structure from motion (SfM). \method simplifies traditional SfM pipelines by utilizing recent advances in deep 2D point tracking to directly extract reliable pixel-accurate correspondences across all input images. It then estimates all camera poses simultaneously using a Transformer network based on these tracks and image features. Next, a Transformer network triangulates an initial 3D point cloud. Finally, a differentiable bundle adjustment layer refines the reconstruction. Through end-to-end training, each component enhances subsequent stages. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on camera pose estimation and 3D triangulation. The accuracy and scalability advances come from the model simplicity and joint training enabled by the fully differentiable design. Qualitative results also showcase successful reconstructions on challenging in-the-wild photos. In summary, this work presents a simplified, fully differentiable SfM pipeline with strong empirical performance.
