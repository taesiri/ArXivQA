# [Know Your Audience: Do LLMs Adapt to Different Age and Education Levels?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02065)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper evaluates how well four large language models (LLMs) - two commercial (ChatGPT, GPT-3) and two open-source (BigScience, Flan-T5) - adapt their generated responses to science questions when prompted for different age groups and education levels. It assesses the readability of the LLM responses using standard metrics like Flesch-Kincaid. The authors find that while models like GPT-3 and Flan-T5 exhibit some expected trends in readability scores for certain education levels, overall the models do not reliably adapt their outputs to target age groups or difficulty levels, even when explicitly prompted. On average only 15% of responses fell into the recommended readability range. An additional classification test showed no significant measurable differences in the texts. The results indicate current LLMs have limited ability to tailor responses to suit different audiences, making them poorly suited for educational purposes where age-appropriate explanations are critical. The authors argue this demonstrates the need to enhance model adaptability, particularly for uses in education.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper investigates how well large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can adapt their generated text to be appropriate for readers of different age groups and education levels when explicitly prompted to do so. This is an important capability for using LLMs in educational settings. 

Methodology:
The authors prompt 4 LLMs (ChatGPT, GPT-3, BigScience, Flan-T5) to answer 100 science questions for different target age groups (11 to 23 years old) and education levels (5th grade to college graduate). They collect and analyze 33,600 prompt-response pairs. Using Flesch-Kincaid readability metrics, they assess whether each LLM adapts the reading difficulty of its responses to match the reading comprehension level expected for the age/education level specified in the prompt.

Key Findings:  
- LLMs do not reliably adapt their responses to target different age groups and education levels, even when explicitly prompted.  
- Each LLM tends to produce responses in a narrow band of reading difficulty, regardless of prompts.
- The probability of an LLM generating a response with reading level appropriate for the prompted age/education is only ~15%. 

Main Contributions:
- Evidence that current LLMs have limited ability to adapt output reading level for different audiences 
- Demonstrates need to enhance LLM adaptability for education purposes
- Provides methodology and dataset for further research into LLM adaptation capabilities

In summary, the study reveals difficulties faced by current LLMs in adapting text for readers of different ages and education levels - an important capability for using LLMs effectively in education. The authors provide empirical evidence of this limitation and contribute a methodology and dataset to further advance research on improving LLM adaptability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates how well four large language models (two commercial and two open-source) adapt their generated responses to science questions for different target audiences of varying age and education levels when explicitly prompted, finding that they do not reliably adapt as measured by standard readability metrics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors show that current large language models (LLMs) do not effectively adapt their output to specific targets like age groups, education levels, and difficulty levels except for very advanced categories, making them ill-suited for educational purposes. 

2. They also show that common readability metrics are not completely reliable for determining the education level of LLM-generated responses. 

3. They release a dataset of questions, LLM responses, and readability metrics for further study by other researchers.

In summary, the key contribution is an analysis demonstrating that LLMs currently have limitations in adapting their outputs for audiences of different ages and education levels, which limits their potential use for educational applications. The authors also contribute a new dataset to enable further research in this area.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with it include:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Readability
- Age appropriateness 
- Education levels
- Adaptability
- Prompting
- Flesch-Kincaid Readability Metrics
- FKRE (Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease)
- FKGL (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level)  
- Science questions
- Audience adaptation 
- Instruction-based models
- Causal models
- Commercial models (ChatGPT, GPT-3)
- Open-source models (BigScience, Flan-T5)
- Classification evaluation
- Target groups (age, education level, difficulty level)

The paper examines how well large language models are able to adapt their responses to science questions based on prompts specifying different target age groups, education levels, and difficulty levels. It evaluates this using Flesch-Kincaid readability metrics and also by training a classifier. The key finding is that current LLMs do not adapt reliably to different audiences.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper uses the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease (FKRE) index as the primary readability metric. Why was this metric chosen over other commonly used readability metrics like Gunning Fog Index or SMOG index? What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of FKRE for evaluating LLM adaptability?

2. The prompts designed for the LLMs incorporate variables representing age, education level, and difficulty level appropriateness. What considerations went into formulating these prompts to encourage adaptation by the models? How could the prompting strategy be improved?  

3. The paper evaluates both causal language models like GPT-3 and instruction-based models like ChatGPT. What differences would you expect in the adaptability of these two types of models based on their underlying architectures? Did the results reflect those expectations?

4. The authors use a classification-based evaluation in addition to directly assessing readability scores. What was the motivation behind this additional analysis? What limitations still exist in using classification evaluation to validate the readability findings?

5. The paper concludes that current LLMs have limited ability to adapt their responses to specified age and education levels. Based on the analysis presented, what areas would need the most improvement to make LLMs more adaptable for educational applications?

6. The dataset used 100 science questions generated by ChatGPT. What potential issues could arise from using AI-generated questions as the evaluation dataset? How could the question dataset be improved?

7. The paper mainly focuses on adaptability in terms of readability and comprehension level appropriateness. What other metrics of quality and adaptability would be useful to evaluate, especially for educational use cases?

8. What risks or ethical concerns might arise from deploying current LLMs without proper adaptations in an educational context spanning different age groups?

9. The results are analyzed using averages across questions and runs. What variances were observed across questions and runs? Could a more fine-grained qualitative analysis provide additional insights?

10. The paper studies four widely used LLMs with different underlying architectures. Would you expect similar results if additional models from different families were included? What would an ideal cross-section of models look like for evaluating adaptability?
