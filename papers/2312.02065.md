# [Know Your Audience: Do LLMs Adapt to Different Age and Education Levels?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02065)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper evaluates how well four large language models (LLMs) - two commercial (ChatGPT, GPT-3) and two open-source (BigScience, Flan-T5) - adapt their generated responses to science questions when prompted for different age groups and education levels. It assesses the readability of the LLM responses using standard metrics like Flesch-Kincaid. The authors find that while models like GPT-3 and Flan-T5 exhibit some expected trends in readability scores for certain education levels, overall the models do not reliably adapt their outputs to target age groups or difficulty levels, even when explicitly prompted. On average only 15% of responses fell into the recommended readability range. An additional classification test showed no significant measurable differences in the texts. The results indicate current LLMs have limited ability to tailor responses to suit different audiences, making them poorly suited for educational purposes where age-appropriate explanations are critical. The authors argue this demonstrates the need to enhance model adaptability, particularly for uses in education.
