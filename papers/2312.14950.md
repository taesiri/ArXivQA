# [TypeFly: Flying Drones with Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14950)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Controlling drones with natural language is desirable for usability but challenging to implement in practice. Emerging large language models (LLMs) provide an opportunity to automatically translate natural language commands into executable drone control programs. However, state-of-the-art LLMs have limitations around privacy (sending images to the cloud), efficiency (high cost for large requests), and capability (difficulty generating specialized drone programs without fine-tuning).

Proposed Solution: The authors introduce TypeFly, a system that addresses the above challenges using edge-based vision processing, a custom mini programming language called MiniSpec, and prompt engineering techniques. Key ideas include:

- Privacy: An on-premise edge server processes drone images into text scene descriptions using computer vision. Only text is sent to the LLM cloud service. 

- Efficiency: MiniSpec is a small language that allows LLMs to generate concise drone control programs with fewer tokens, reducing cost.

- Capability: TypeFly features a "query" mechanism where programs can query the LLM during execution for dynamic reasoning. Prompt engineering further enhances LLM performance.

Main Contributions:

- First end-to-end system enabling drones to accomplish complex tasks described in natural language

- MiniSpec - a small, efficient language for LLMs to write drone programs 

- Query mechanism to engage LLMs during program execution for improved reasoning

- Prompt engineering techniques that enhance LLM capability for drone programming

- Evaluation on 12 increasingly difficult tasks shows TypeFly reduces LLM cost and drone task execution time by over 2x compared to using Python. The query mechanism and prompt engineering are critical for success, especially on complex tasks.

In summary, TypeFly uniquely combines edge intelligence, language design, query mechanism and prompt engineering to overcome key limitations in using LLMs for drone control. Experiments validate efficiency gains and new capabilities unlocked by TypeFly's innovations.
