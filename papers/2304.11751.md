# [Score-Based Diffusion Models as Principled Priors for Inverse Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11751)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we incorporate sophisticated learned image priors into principled Bayesian approaches for solving inverse problems in imaging?

More specifically, the paper proposes using score-based diffusion models as principled image priors ("score-based priors") that can be plugged into Bayesian inference algorithms that require a differentiable prior distribution. 

The key ideas and contributions appear to be:

- Establishing that the probability density function of a score-based diffusion model can be computed exactly, allowing it to be used as a standalone prior. The authors empirically validate the accuracy of log-probability calculations.

- Demonstrating that score-based priors can be incorporated into variational inference for sampling from rich posteriors over images, given measurements. This provides a principled Bayesian approach using a learned prior.

- Validating through experiments on imaging tasks like denoising, deblurring, and interferometric imaging that score-based priors enable more sophisticated and robust solutions compared to previous learned priors or hand-crafted regularizers.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that score-based diffusion models can provide rich, principled priors to enhance Bayesian approaches for solving ill-posed inverse problems in imaging. The experiments aim to validate that score-based priors offer benefits over previous priors and posteriors sampling methods.
