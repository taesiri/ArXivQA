# [Score-Based Diffusion Models as Principled Priors for Inverse Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11751)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we incorporate sophisticated learned image priors into principled Bayesian approaches for solving inverse problems in imaging?

More specifically, the paper proposes using score-based diffusion models as principled image priors ("score-based priors") that can be plugged into Bayesian inference algorithms that require a differentiable prior distribution. 

The key ideas and contributions appear to be:

- Establishing that the probability density function of a score-based diffusion model can be computed exactly, allowing it to be used as a standalone prior. The authors empirically validate the accuracy of log-probability calculations.

- Demonstrating that score-based priors can be incorporated into variational inference for sampling from rich posteriors over images, given measurements. This provides a principled Bayesian approach using a learned prior.

- Validating through experiments on imaging tasks like denoising, deblurring, and interferometric imaging that score-based priors enable more sophisticated and robust solutions compared to previous learned priors or hand-crafted regularizers.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that score-based diffusion models can provide rich, principled priors to enhance Bayesian approaches for solving ill-posed inverse problems in imaging. The experiments aim to validate that score-based priors offer benefits over previous priors and posteriors sampling methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing the use of score-based diffusion models as principled image priors for Bayesian inference in imaging inverse problems. 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

- Showing how to compute the log probability of images under a score-based diffusion model, and empirically validating the accuracy of the probabilities. This establishes score-based diffusion models as truly probabilistic image priors.

- Proposing to use score-based diffusion models as the image prior within a Bayesian inference framework for solving inverse problems like denoising, deblurring, and interferometric imaging. This allows leveraging the rich image statistics captured by the diffusion model prior in a principled Bayesian approach. 

- Demonstrating a variational inference method for posterior sampling that uses the score-based prior. This enables sampling from the posterior distribution to analyze uncertainty.

- Evaluating the proposed score-based priors on imaging tasks and showing they provide more informative posteriors compared to common hand-designed priors like total variation.

- Comparing to previous methods that use diffusion models for inverse problems, and showing the proposed principled Bayesian approach is more robust and does not require problematic tuning of hyperparameters.

In summary, the key contribution is establishing score-based diffusion models as interfaces between deep generative models and principled Bayesian inference, unlocking the benefits of both for solving inverse imaging problems. The proposed framework supports uncertainty quantification and principled inference with learned, rich image priors.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using score-based diffusion models as principled, probabilistic priors for Bayesian inference in inverse problems, allowing for posterior sampling that leverages expressive, data-driven priors while automatically balancing the strengths of the prior and likelihood.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on score-based diffusion models and their use for inverse imaging problems:

- It provides empirical validation of the theoretically proven probability function for score-based diffusion models. Prior work has mostly discussed this capability in theory without demonstrating it. This paper empirically shows the accuracy of computed log probabilities on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

- It proposes using score-based diffusion models as standalone, principled priors that can be combined with any likelihood model for Bayesian inference. Most prior work has focused on turning diffusion models into conditional samplers by entangling measurements with the sampling process. This limits the generalizability of the diffusion model and requires careful tuning.

- It demonstrates variational inference for posterior sampling by directly modeling the posterior distribution. This avoids complications with trying to sample from an approximate conditional distribution. The authors show this enables more accurate and robust posterior estimation compared to prior methods.

- It highlights the usefulness of score-based priors specifically for scientific imaging applications like black hole imaging. The principled nature of the priors enables proper uncertainty quantification, which is important for scientific analysis and interpretation.

Overall, this work makes significant contributions around establishing score-based diffusion models as practical, standalone priors that enable principled Bayesian analysis. It backs up the theoretical probability framework with empirical validation, and demonstrates the benefits over prior diffusion-based approaches through controlled experiments and applications to inverse problems in imaging. The principled integration of data-driven priors into traditional Bayesian inference is an important direction for improving deep learning-based imaging.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more efficient and scalable ways to compute the log-probability and gradient under a score-based diffusion model. The authors note that evaluating the probability flow ODE can be computationally expensive, especially when done repeatedly in an optimization loop for variational inference. Improving the efficiency and reducing memory costs of log-probability calculations could help scale up the approach.

- Exploring different posterior approximation families beyond the normalizing flow used in this paper. The quality of the variational posterior approximation depends on how well the parameterized distribution family can capture the true posterior. Trying more flexible and expressive parametric families could potentially improve results.

- Applying score-based priors to a wider range of inverse problems and likelihood models beyond the ones demonstrated. The modularity and generality of the framework means it can likely be adapted to many imaging settings.

- Developing better training procedures and network architectures for learning more accurate and generalizable score-based priors from data. The quality of results depends on how well the score model approximates the true data distribution.

- Combining score-based priors with other regularization strategies in a principled way. Certain structure could be encouraged by having a hybrid prior composed of a score-based model and simple regularizer terms.

- Using collections of score-based priors together to identify robust structure. As mentioned for black hole imaging, combining posteriors from an ensemble of priors trained on different datasets may reveal more reliable features.

- Evaluating the approach on real-world imaging tasks and datasets. Though promising results are shown on simulated data, testing on real-world applications could reveal limitations and areas for improvement.
