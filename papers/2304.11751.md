# [Score-Based Diffusion Models as Principled Priors for Inverse Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11751)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we incorporate sophisticated learned image priors into principled Bayesian approaches for solving inverse problems in imaging?

More specifically, the paper proposes using score-based diffusion models as principled image priors ("score-based priors") that can be plugged into Bayesian inference algorithms that require a differentiable prior distribution. 

The key ideas and contributions appear to be:

- Establishing that the probability density function of a score-based diffusion model can be computed exactly, allowing it to be used as a standalone prior. The authors empirically validate the accuracy of log-probability calculations.

- Demonstrating that score-based priors can be incorporated into variational inference for sampling from rich posteriors over images, given measurements. This provides a principled Bayesian approach using a learned prior.

- Validating through experiments on imaging tasks like denoising, deblurring, and interferometric imaging that score-based priors enable more sophisticated and robust solutions compared to previous learned priors or hand-crafted regularizers.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that score-based diffusion models can provide rich, principled priors to enhance Bayesian approaches for solving ill-posed inverse problems in imaging. The experiments aim to validate that score-based priors offer benefits over previous priors and posteriors sampling methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing the use of score-based diffusion models as principled image priors for Bayesian inference in imaging inverse problems. 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

- Showing how to compute the log probability of images under a score-based diffusion model, and empirically validating the accuracy of the probabilities. This establishes score-based diffusion models as truly probabilistic image priors.

- Proposing to use score-based diffusion models as the image prior within a Bayesian inference framework for solving inverse problems like denoising, deblurring, and interferometric imaging. This allows leveraging the rich image statistics captured by the diffusion model prior in a principled Bayesian approach. 

- Demonstrating a variational inference method for posterior sampling that uses the score-based prior. This enables sampling from the posterior distribution to analyze uncertainty.

- Evaluating the proposed score-based priors on imaging tasks and showing they provide more informative posteriors compared to common hand-designed priors like total variation.

- Comparing to previous methods that use diffusion models for inverse problems, and showing the proposed principled Bayesian approach is more robust and does not require problematic tuning of hyperparameters.

In summary, the key contribution is establishing score-based diffusion models as interfaces between deep generative models and principled Bayesian inference, unlocking the benefits of both for solving inverse imaging problems. The proposed framework supports uncertainty quantification and principled inference with learned, rich image priors.
