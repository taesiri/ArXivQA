# [Diff-PCR: Diffusion-Based Correspondence Searching in Doubly Stochastic   Matrix Space for Point Cloud Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00436)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Finding optimal correspondences between point clouds is important for rigid and non-rigid point cloud registration. 
- Existing methods rely on features to establish correspondences and estimate transformations/flow fields. Recent methods use RAFT-like updates to refine solutions.
- However, these iterative updates lack transparency on why only a few iterations work best. The updates follow a fixed path which can lead to suboptimal results.
- These methods also don't optimize correspondences before solving for transformations, relying on one-shot prediction of correspondences based on point features. This can be far from globally optimal.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes novel framework to optimize matching matrix in doubly stochastic matrix space using diffusion models.
- Models forward diffusion of matching matrix with Gaussian noise. Learns reverse denoising process to iteratively search for better solutions.
- Denoising gradient points towards maximum likelihood direction of target matching matrix. Allows search from any initial matrix.
- Iterative search makes it robust and less sensitive to starting point. Prevents getting stuck in local optima.

Main Contributions:
- First work to use diffusion models for iterative search of optimal matching matrices in registration. Can be integrated into various 2D-2D, 2D-3D and 3D-3D problems.

- Enables reverse sampling from reliable initial solution of backbone network, accelerating convergence. Also possible to sample from noise.

- Comprehensive experiments on 3DMatch and 4DMatch for rigid and non-rigid registration demonstrate effectiveness. Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel diffusion-based framework for optimizing correspondences in point cloud registration. By modeling the search process as a diffusion model and learning a reliable denoising gradient, the method can effectively find globally optimal matching matrices regardless of initialization. Experiments validate the robustness and efficacy of the approach.
