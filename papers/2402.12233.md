# [Empirical Study on Updating Key-Value Memories in Transformer   Feed-forward Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12233)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies how information is processed and stored in the feed-forward networks (FFNs) of Transformer models. FFNs are conceptualized as key-value memories, where the keys determine which values (stored knowledge concepts) get activated for a given input. The question is - what is the best way to update this knowledge? Should we directly modify the values or change the keys to alter which values get activated?

Methodology:
The authors compare updating the keys vs values in FFN layers for various tuning tasks:
- Knowledge editing: Changing specific facts stored in the model while preserving irrelevant information 
- Multi-task tuning: Tuning on multiple datasets/tasks jointly
- Instruction tuning: Tuning model for a specific natural language instruction 

The tuning is done by either:
1) Updating values (directly changing stored knowledge) 
2) Updating keys (changing which values are activated)

The comparison is done on multiple models - GPT-J, GPT2-XL, LLaMA.

Key Results:
- Updating keys consistently outperforms updating values across models and tasks
- Modifying keys gives better generalization and specificity in knowledge editing
- Updating keys is more parameter efficient 
- Tuning keys is much faster compared to directly modifying values

Main Conclusions:
The key insight is that compared to directly changing the knowledge concepts stored in the model, altering the mechanism that controls this knowledge (i.e. keys) is more effective for tuning. This highlights that transformers use the FFN keys to gate the usage of knowledge rather than just storing facts in the values.

In summary, the paper provides an empirical comparison of different ways to update information in transformer feed-forward layers, demonstrating the superiority of modifying keys over values.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper empirically compares updating keys versus values in transformer feed-forward layers for knowledge editing and fine-tuning tasks, finding that tuning keys tends to yield better performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an empirical ablation study comparing two methods for updating the key-value memories in the feed-forward networks (FFNs) of transformers:

1) Tuning the values (the 2nd layer in the FFNs) which directly modifies the knowledge stored in the model.

2) Tuning the keys (the 1st layer in the FFNs) which alters the mechanism of how existing knowledge is controlled and accessed.

Through experiments on knowledge editing, multi-task tuning, and instruction tuning, the authors find that updating keys consistently outperforms updating values across various scenarios and pretrained language models. 

The key insight is that compared to directly changing the knowledge itself, modifying the way the model controls its knowledge can be a more effective way to update and tune large language models. The empirical study provides evidence that transformers store knowledge in the values within feed-forward networks, while the keys act as an indexing or gating mechanism for accessing that knowledge.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Feed-forward networks (FFNs)
- Key-value memories
- Knowledge editing
- Updating keys vs values
- Pre-trained transformers
- Language models
- Ablation study
- LoRA tuning
- Instruction tuning
- Multi-task tuning

The main ideas explored are using FFNs in transformers as key-value memories, and comparing methods for updating them by either modifying the "keys" or "values". This is tested in tasks like knowledge editing and LoRA tuning of large language models. The paper presents an empirical ablation study on these different updating approaches.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares updating keys vs values in transformer feedforward networks for tasks like knowledge editing. What are the theoretical advantages and disadvantages of each approach? For example, how might updating keys allow more flexible control over existing knowledge compared to overwriting values? 

2. The paper shows superior performance from updating keys instead of values across several experiments. However, are there any scenarios you can envision where updating values would be more appropriate or effective? Explain your reasoning.

3. The authors suggest that updating keys is superior because it only involves changing the inner product between keys and hidden states, while updating values requires more complex optimization. Do you agree with this explanation fully? Can you think of any other potential reasons for keys being more effective to update?

4. Could the relative efficacies of tuning keys vs values depend at all on what layer of the transformer you are modifying? For example, might updating earlier layers' values be more impactful than later layers? Why or why not?  

5. The improvements from updating keys over values appear more marginal in some experiments compared to others. What factors may contribute to the gap being more or less significant?

6. How do you think the key-value perspective relates to attention-based perspectives on transformer self-attention and feedforward blocks? Could updating attention weights and updating keys give similar effects? Why or why not?

7. For real-world model deployment, do you think updating keys or values would be more practical? Explain considerations like computational overhead, implementation complexity, etc.

8. The authors use knowledge editing as an example use case for updating neural memories. Can you think of other promising applications where dynamic updating of keys or values could be useful?

9. The paper focuses on updating either keys or values exclusively. What potential benefits or challenges do you foresee if one updated keys and values jointly instead? When might a joint approach be preferred or not?

10. The authors only examine updating feedforward network keys and values exclusively. How do you think results might differ if self-attention keys and values were updated instead? Can you hypothesize any reasons self-attention updates might yield different efficacies?
