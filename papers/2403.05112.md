# [RLPeri: Accelerating Visual Perimetry Test with Reinforcement Learning   and Convolutional Feature Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05112)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Visual perimetry is an important diagnostic test for detecting vision problems by assessing a patient's visual field and sensitivity to light. During the test, the patient focuses their gaze while light stimuli of varying intensities are presented across their field of view. They are asked to respond "seen" or "not seen" depending on if they perceive the light stimuli. However, the test can be lengthy, taking 3-15 minutes per eye, and requires high levels of patient concentration and attention. This leads to issues with fatigue, unreliable results, and overall difficulty for patients. There is a need for improved strategies to optimize the testing procedure.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose an RLPeri approach based on reinforcement learning and convolutional feature extraction to optimize the sequence of locations tested and initial stimulus intensity values. This allows reducing examination time while preserving accuracy. Specifically:
- They formulate perimetry testing as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for sequential decision making.
- They introduce potential-based reward shaping to balance speed and accuracy objectives. 
- They represent the test state using "seen" and "not seen" 3D matrices to capture patient responses over different stimuli and locations in full detail.
- They apply specialized convolution kernels to extract relevant state features related to threshold sensitivity of neighboring locations and patient perceptibility over a range of stimuli intensities.
- They employ the ZEST procedure to estimate final sensitivity thresholds at each location.

Main Contributions:
- Novel RL formulation for optimizing full visual field testing sequence and parameters to enhance efficiency.  
- Introduction of reward shaping in this problem context to strike improved balance between test speed and accuracy.
- State representation using 3D response matrices along with tailored convolution kernels for effective feature extraction.
- Experiments demonstrate 10-20% faster examination times while preserving accuracy levels compared to baseline and state-of-the-art techniques.

Overall, the paper presents a new reinforcement learning strategy to significantly expedite visual perimetry testing without compromising on accuracy or reliability of the diagnostic results. By optimizing the entire test sequence adaptively, it aims to provide faster and easier tests for assessing vision defects.
