# [RLPeri: Accelerating Visual Perimetry Test with Reinforcement Learning   and Convolutional Feature Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05112)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Visual perimetry is an important diagnostic test for detecting vision problems by assessing a patient's visual field and sensitivity to light. During the test, the patient focuses their gaze while light stimuli of varying intensities are presented across their field of view. They are asked to respond "seen" or "not seen" depending on if they perceive the light stimuli. However, the test can be lengthy, taking 3-15 minutes per eye, and requires high levels of patient concentration and attention. This leads to issues with fatigue, unreliable results, and overall difficulty for patients. There is a need for improved strategies to optimize the testing procedure.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose an RLPeri approach based on reinforcement learning and convolutional feature extraction to optimize the sequence of locations tested and initial stimulus intensity values. This allows reducing examination time while preserving accuracy. Specifically:
- They formulate perimetry testing as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for sequential decision making.
- They introduce potential-based reward shaping to balance speed and accuracy objectives. 
- They represent the test state using "seen" and "not seen" 3D matrices to capture patient responses over different stimuli and locations in full detail.
- They apply specialized convolution kernels to extract relevant state features related to threshold sensitivity of neighboring locations and patient perceptibility over a range of stimuli intensities.
- They employ the ZEST procedure to estimate final sensitivity thresholds at each location.

Main Contributions:
- Novel RL formulation for optimizing full visual field testing sequence and parameters to enhance efficiency.  
- Introduction of reward shaping in this problem context to strike improved balance between test speed and accuracy.
- State representation using 3D response matrices along with tailored convolution kernels for effective feature extraction.
- Experiments demonstrate 10-20% faster examination times while preserving accuracy levels compared to baseline and state-of-the-art techniques.

Overall, the paper presents a new reinforcement learning strategy to significantly expedite visual perimetry testing without compromising on accuracy or reliability of the diagnostic results. By optimizing the entire test sequence adaptively, it aims to provide faster and easier tests for assessing vision defects.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes RLPeri, a reinforcement learning approach to optimize visual perimetry testing that determines the optimal sequence of locations and initial stimulus values to reduce examination time by 10-20\% while maintaining accuracy by using reward shaping and representing the test state with 3D matrices along with specialized convolutional kernels to extract features.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

Formulating perimetry testing as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and proposing an RL-based method called RLPeri to determine the optimal sequence of locations and initial stimulus values for faster and more accurate visual field testing. The method uses potential-based reward shaping to balance speed and accuracy, represents the test state with 3D matrices, and employs convolutional kernels to extract relevant features. Through experiments, the paper demonstrates that RLPeri reduces examination time by 10-20% while maintaining accuracy compared to previous approaches.

In summary, the key contribution is an RL-based strategy to optimize the visual perimetry testing procedure for improved efficiency and patient-friendliness.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper utilizes a pair of 3D matrices to represent the state. Why is this proposed over a simpler 2D matrix representation? How does this choice of state representation impact learning?

2. The paper extracts features from the state matrices using both group-wise and point-wise convolution kernels. What is the intuition behind using these two different types of kernels? How do they help capture relevant state features? 

3. Reward shaping is used to balance the trade-off between speed and accuracy. How exactly is the potential function designed in this work? What impact does this choice of potential function have on learning?

4. The branching architecture is used to estimate Q-values. What is the motivation behind learning two separate Q-functions? How does this architecture handle the large joint action space?

5. The stopping criterion for ZEST uses the standard deviation of the estimated PDF. How does this parameter impact testing accuracy and duration? What is a reasonable value to use in practice?

6. What assumptions does the likelihood function make in the ZEST algorithm? How valid are these assumptions for modeling patient responses in perimetry testing?

7. Patient responses are probabilistic based on the FOS curve. How is an FOS curve estimated for each location? What is the impact of errors in FOS curve estimation?

8. How are spatial relationships between neighboring location thresholds modeled? Does the order of testing locations exploit these spatial relationships?

9. Could transfer learning or multi-task learning be utilized to account for similarities between different patient visual fields? If yes, how?

10. The proposed RL approach optimizes the entire test duration and accuracy. How does this method qualitatively differ from approaches that use RL to select a fixed set of locations? When is each approach suitable?
