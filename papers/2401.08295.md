# [DAPT: A Dual Attention Framework for Parameter-Efficient Continual   Learning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08295)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Continual learning (CL) is crucial for deploying large language models (LLMs) to dynamically adapt to new tasks, but faces challenges of catastrophic forgetting (CF) of old knowledge and ineffective knowledge transfer (KT) to new tasks.  
- Existing PET (parameter-efficient tuning)-based CL methods have limitations in their learning module design and selection module design to address CF and facilitate KT simultaneously. They also do not consider aligning the two modules.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel framework called DAPT with two key components:
   - Dual-Attentive Learning & Selection Module (DALS): Aligns PET learning and selection via a shared instance-level attention weight over existing PET blocks to determine the optimal combinations catered to each input, enabling simultaneous mitigation of CF and promotion of KT.  
   - Attentive Reflection Module (ARM): Pulls projection layer's attention weights for previous tasks' samples towards original values through generative replay, preventing attention drift.

Main Contributions:  
- Proposes aligning PET learning and selection processes via a shared attention weight in DALS module to simultaneously counter CF and enable KT when expanding LLMs for continual learning.
- Introduces ARM module to prevent attention drift over time for previous tasks via generative replay.
- Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on two CL benchmarks compared to existing methods. Also demonstrates scalability to larger model sizes and applicability to unseen tasks.  

In summary, the key novelty is in aligning PET learning and selection modules via a shared dual attention mechanism along with a generative replay-based solution to mitigate attention drift over time. This enables both effective knowledge retention and transfer leading to overall enhanced continual learning capability for LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes DAPT, a novel framework for continual learning of large language models that aligns the parameter-efficient tuning learning and selection processes through a shared dual-attention mechanism to simultaneously address catastrophic forgetting and promote knowledge transfer.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Studying the continual learning (CL) of large language models (LLMs) to make them more practical for real-world applications. 

2. Proposing a novel framework called DAPT that aligns the PET learning and selection processes through a shared dual attention weight. This allows DAPT to effectively address the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and facilitating knowledge transfer simultaneously.

3. Conducting extensive experiments on benchmark datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness of DAPT in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and promoting knowledge transfer compared to previous PET-based continual learning methods.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the DAPT framework that can do continual learning of LLMs while dealing with catastrophic forgetting and enabling knowledge transfer at the same time. The experiments then validate that DAPT is superior to existing methods on those metrics.
