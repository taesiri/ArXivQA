## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a Physical Symbolic Optimization (PhySO) framework for constraining the automatic generation of analytical equations to obey dimensional analysis rules. By incorporating an in situ supervised learning component, the recurrent neural network guiding the symbolic regression is taught dimensional analysis principles, directing its exploration toward physically consistent equations. PhySO combines this with state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques for symbolic regression, using a risk-seeking policy gradient strategy. Evaluated on the SRBench benchmark, PhySO achieves top performance in exact symbolic recovery of concise and interpretable expressions in the presence of noise, substantially outperforming all other methods at noise levels exceeding 0.1%. This demonstrates the value of leveraging dimensional analysis constraints in physical science contexts where units are known. By discovering analytical functions that align with the dimensional requirements intrinsic to the data, PhySO facilitates the integration of learned empirical laws into overarching physical theories.
