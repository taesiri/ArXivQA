# [Self-supervised Learning for Electroencephalogram: A Systematic Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05446)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain abundant physiological information useful for various downstream tasks like emotion recognition and sleep stage classification. However, building quality labeled EEG datasets for training deep learning models is difficult due to high labeling cost and variability across subjects. 

- Supervised learning suffers from label scarcity and inconsistency issues for EEG analysis. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can mitigate these issues by pre-training on unlabeled data.

Solution:
- This paper provides a systematic review categorizing SSL methods for EEG analysis into predictive, generative, contrastive and hybrid frameworks inspired from computer vision and NLP.

- Predictive methods classify EEG signals augmented by spatial, temporal or frequency transformations. Generative methods reconstruct masked or transformed EEG signals. Contrastive methods maximize mutual information between augmentations of the same EEG signals. Hybrid methods combine multiple pretext tasks.

- Various EEG analysis tasks like emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, pathology detection, motor imagery decoding, image/speech decoding are improved using SSL representations fine-tuned on small labeled datasets.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive taxonomy and review of self-supervised learning techniques tailored for EEG analysis. 

- Detailed technical analysis and mathematical formulation of predictive, generative, contrastive and hybrid SSL frameworks applied on EEG signals.

- Discussion of multiple downstream tasks in EEG analysis where SSL representations enhance performance over fully supervised approaches. 

- Identification of challenges and proposal of future research directions in developing EEG-specific SSL techniques leveraging neural knowledge and multimodal signals.
