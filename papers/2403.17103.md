# [Animal Avatars: Reconstructing Animatable 3D Animals from Casual Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17103)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Animal Avatars: Reconstructing Animatable 3D Animals from Casual Videos":

Problem:
- Reconstructing detailed 3D models of animals, especially dogs, from monocular videos captured by consumer devices is valuable for AR/VR applications but is challenging due to the non-rigid shape and texture variations of animals. 
- Prior template-based methods rely on sparse 2D keypoints for fitting, failing on unconventional views. Template-free methods can handle more deformation but produce implausible shapes.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverages the SMAL articulated quadruped model, enhances fitting via dense correspondences from Continuous Surface Embeddings (CSE), and models texture using an implicit neural radiance field.
- Establishes per-vertex dense correspondences between SMAL and images using pretrained CSE coordinate regression. Provides supervision even for rear views.  
- Factors out camera motion using SfM for temporally coherent pose optimization.
- Defines implicit texture field using a duplex mesh scaffold that allows articulation and rendering of texture.

Main Contributions:
- Integrates CSE with SMAL model for accurate and dense image-to-template correspondences to guide fitting.
- Decouples global camera motion and local pose changes for coherent video reconstruction.  
- Introduces articulated implicit neural texture field based on duplex mesh, enabling texturing of SMAL model.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CoP3D and APTv2 datasets compared to other template-based and free approaches in terms of pose accuracy, texture quality and plausibility.
