# [Optimizing contrastive learning for cortical folding pattern detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18035)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The folds and bumps (gyri and sulci) on the human cerebral cortex show high inter-individual variability. Studying this variability can reveal biomarkers related to neurodevelopmental disorders or genetics.
- Specific cortical folding patterns have been correlated to epilepsy, schizophrenia, and cognitive abilities. However, manually detecting patterns is time-consuming and supervised learning requires already-known patterns. 

Proposed Solution:
- Use an unsupervised contrastive learning model (SimCLR) to learn a representation of cortical folding from MRI scans that permits automatic detection of relevant folding patterns. 
- Apply SimCLR to cortical skeleton surfaces which capture folding shapes and are more stable across ages and acquisition sites.
- Introduce topology-based data augmentations utilizing the graph structure of cortical folds.
- Optimize SimCLR on 1101 subjects from the Human Connectome Project and 21070 subjects from UK Biobank.
- Evaluate model by detecting a clinically validated "double parallel" fold pattern in the cingulate cortex related to schizophrenia on 341 manually labeled scans.

Main Contributions:
- First application of self-supervised deep learning on cortical skeletons at this scale. Previous largest study had 1101 subjects.
- Novel graph-based augmentations for medical images using topological information.
- Quantitative evaluation and optimization of model for folding pattern detection task.
- Show model transfers well across datasets and is resilient to differences in age and acquisition site.
- Best model obtains 0.76 AUC for detecting the double parallel fold.
- Framework presented enables future detection of other cortical biomarkers in large datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops and evaluates a self-supervised deep learning model using contrastive learning to detect cortical folding patterns in MRI images, achieving good performance in detecting a specific double-parallel folding pattern related to schizophrenia.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

The development and optimization of a self-supervised deep learning model (specifically SimCLR) for detecting cortical folding patterns in MRI images. The key aspects include:

- Applying SimCLR with topological augmentations to cortical skeleton representations of over 20,000 subjects, which is the first time a self-supervised model has been applied to such a large dataset of cortical skeletons.

- Implementing and evaluating topology-based data augmentations that leverage the graph structure of cortical folds, such as the "branch clipping" augmentation. 

- Optimizing the SimCLR model, including testing different backbone architectures and hyperparameters, using a manually labeled folding pattern dataset (double parallel fold) for quantitative evaluation. 

- Demonstrating that the learned representations are resilient to changes in training dataset, age, and acquisition site.

- Obtaining a SimCLR model, using a simple CNN backbone and branch clipping augmentations, that achieves 0.76 AUC for detecting the double parallel fold pattern.

In summary, the key contribution is advancing self-supervised learning for cortical folding analysis through the development, optimization, and evaluation of SimCLR models on large datasets of cortical skeletons. The resulting representations show promise for detecting anatomical biomarkers.

 According to the paper, the keywords are:

Contrastive learning, SimCLR, MRI, brain, folding pattern

These keywords are listed at the end of the abstract section:

So the key terms that summarize this paper are:
- Contrastive learning: The paper uses a contrastive self-supervised learning model called SimCLR to learn representations of cortical folding patterns.
- SimCLR: This refers to the Simple Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations model used.  
- MRI: The input data are magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the brain.
- Brain: Specifically looking at cortical folding patterns in the brain.
- Folding pattern: The goal is to detect specific folding patterns in certain brain regions that can serve as biomarkers.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using topology-based augmentations like "cutout" and "branch-clipping" to generate views for the SimCLR model. Can you explain in more detail how these augmentations work and why they are suited for cortical folding patterns? 

2. Three different neural network architectures (ConvNet, DenseNet, PointNet) are tested as backbones for SimCLR. What are the key differences between these architectures and what motivates their choice for this application?

3. The paper finds that a simple 6-layer ConvNet works best as the SimCLR backbone. Why do you think a simpler architecture outperforms more complex ones like DenseNet in this case? 

4. Contrastive self-supervised learning requires generating multiple views of the same input data sample. Besides the augmentations mentioned, can you think of any other ways to generate views that could improve results?

5. The paper uses cortical skeletons as input rather than raw MRI scans. What advantages do cortical skeletons provide over using raw scans directly? Could there also be any disadvantages?

6. What challenges are there in applying self-supervised techniques like SimCLR versus supervised methods for detecting cortical folding patterns? How does the paper address some of these challenges?

7. The best results are obtained by training SimCLR on over 20,000 subjects from UKBioBank. What benefits could an even larger training set provide? What practical challenges may arise in scaling up further?

8. How sensitive do you expect the SimCLR representation to be towards differences in MRI scanner models and acquisition protocols? What could be done to improve robustness?  

9. The paper evaluates SimCLR based on classification performance on a labeled double-parallel folding pattern dataset. Can you suggest any other metrics or tasks for evaluating how well the representation captures anatomical shape variability?

10. The paper focuses only on the cingulate region. How easily do you think this approach could be extended to detect folding patterns in other cortical regions? What modifications may be required?
