# [DeepRicci: Self-supervised Graph Structure-Feature Co-Refinement for   Alleviating Over-squashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12780)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
This paper addresses the problem of self-supervised graph structure-feature co-refinement to alleviate the issue of over-squashing in graph neural networks (GNNs). The key issues are:

1) Existing graph structure learning (GSL) methods focus primarily on structure refinement but overlook noisy node features, which also affect GNN performance. 

2) Most GSL methods do not address the over-squashing issue of GNNs, where useful node information gets distorted when propagating through narrow graph paths. 

3) Modeling graph properties like Ricci curvature poses challenges in defining suitable representation spaces, mapping between Riemannian and Euclidean spaces, and differentiable computation.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a self-supervised Riemannian model called DeepRicci that jointly refines graph structure and node features to alleviate over-squashing in GNNs. The key ideas are:

1) A latent Riemannian space is introduced, constructed from a rotational product to enable modeling of diverse Ricci curvatures. This addresses the limitations of existing homogeneous spaces.

2) A gyrovector feature mapping is proposed to map between the Riemannian and Euclidean spaces in an isometry-invariant way.

3) A differentiable formulation of Ricci curvature is presented that serves as an upper bound for the original definition. This enables optimization via gradient descent. 

4) Graph structure is refined via backward Ricci flow based on the differentiable Ricci curvature. This widens graph bottlenecks to alleviate over-squashing.

5) Node features are refined via contrastive learning among different geometric views induced from the Riemannian product factors.

Main Contributions:
The main contributions are:

1) A new formulation of the self-supervised graph structure-feature co-refinement problem to alleviate over-squashing in GNNs.

2) The DeepRicci model that introduces a latent Riemannian space and different components like gyrovector mapping and differentiable Ricci curvature to enable the joint structure-feature refinement.

3) Theoretical analysis showing how backward Ricci flow alleviates over-squashing by increasing the Cheeger constant of graphs.

4) Extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance of DeepRicci over state-of-the-art techniques on node classification and clustering tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a self-supervised graph structure-feature co-refinement method called DeepRicci that introduces a latent Riemannian space to refine the graph structure using backward Ricci flow and refine node features using contrastive learning, in order to alleviate over-squashing in graph neural networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

1. It proposes a new problem of self-supervised graph structure-feature co-refinement to simultaneously refine noisy graph structure and node features without supervision, while also alleviating the over-squashing phenomenon in graph neural networks. 

2. It introduces a novel methodology by taking a fundamentally different Riemannian geometry perspective for graph structure learning:
- Proposes the first Riemannian graph learning model (DeepRicci) with several components: a latent Riemannian space, gyrovector feature mapping, differentiable Ricci curvature formulation, backward Ricci flow for structure refinement, and geometric contrastive learning for feature refinement.
- Provides theoretical guarantees on modeling heterogeneous curvature, isometry invariant mapping, and alleviating over-squashing.

3. Conducts extensive experiments on 4 public datasets to demonstrate the superiority of DeepRicci over state-of-the-art methods on tasks like node classification and clustering. Also empirically validates the connection between Ricci flow and over-squashing.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the problem formulation and Riemannian geometry based methodology for self-supervised graph structure-feature co-refinement to alleviate over-squashing in GNNs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel latent Riemannian space constructed by a rotational product. What is the intuition behind using a rotational product rather than other types of products to construct the latent space? How does the rotational factor contribute to modeling heterogeneous curvatures?

2. The paper proposes a gyrovector feature mapping to bridge between the Riemannian manifold and Euclidean space. Why is an isometry-invariant kernel important for this mapping? How does the proposed gyrovector feature mapping differ from and improve upon existing mappings such as the logarithmic map? 

3. The paper formulates a differentiable Ricci curvature based on Olliver's definition. Why is it important for the Ricci curvature formulation to be differentiable, when most existing definitions involve discrete optimizations? What makes the proposed formulation an upper bound for Ollivier's definition?

4. The paper refines the graph structure via backward Ricci flow. What is the intuition behind using backward rather than forward Ricci flow? How does backward Ricci flow theoretically connect to alleviating over-squashing on graphs?

5. The method performs feature refinement via contrastive learning among different geometric views from the Riemannian factors. Why is contrastive learning suitable for this task? How do the multiple views aid in the refinement?

6. Proposition 4 states that the refined structure alleviates over-squashing by increasing the Cheeger constant. Walk through the mathematical argument provided in the proof. Are there any assumptions that could be relaxed?  

7. The ablation study shows that all components (gyrovector features, Ricci flow, feature refinement) contribute positively. Analyze the results and discuss which components seem most critical. Are the contributions consistent across tasks and datasets?

8. The case study provides an interesting empirical analysis of how Ricci flow connects to over-squashing. What exactly happens over forward vs. backward Ricci flow? How does this align with or differ from the theoretical results?

9. The method complexity is analyzed as O(N^2) owing to the multihead cosine similarity and contrastive learning. Could the method be adapted to reduce this complexity? What would be the tradeoffs?

10. The paper focuses on self-supervised learning, but also compares to supervised methods. When would you expect supervised vs. self-supervised methods to perform better for this task? When would DeepRicci be preferred over supervised methods?
