# [Equilibria in Two-Stage Facility Location with Atomic Clients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03114)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies a two-stage competitive facility location game with atomic clients. In this game, there are two types of strategic agents - facility agents who open facilities at locations, and client agents with certain weights who choose which facility to patronize. The facilities want to maximize the total weight of clients they attract, while the clients want to minimize congestion at their chosen facilities. 

Unlike previous models where clients can split their weights across facilities, here the clients are "atomic" - they must choose one facility to patronize with their full weight. However, clients can randomize over facilities. The client subgame for a given facility placement is a singleton congestion game.

Since client equilibria are no longer unique for a facility placement, analyzing subgame perfect equilibria (SPE) in this atomic model is more complex. The paper studies the existence and efficiency of equilibria.

Key Results:

1) For unweighted clients, SPE always exist. This is shown via a novel potential function argument that handles the multiple equilibria using a hierarchical classification of clients and carefully rounding their strategies. 

2) For weighted clients, SPE may not exist and deciding approximate SPE existence is NP-hard.

3) If equilibria exist, their efficiency is quite good - a tight bound of 2 on the price of anarchy is proven using the weighted participation rate as welfare measure. 

4) For weighted clients, it is open whether the non-existence result for approximate SPE is tight. A Ï†-approximate SPE is conjectured to always exist.

In summary, the paper introduces and solves several foundational questions in the understudied area of competitive facility games with atomic clients. The results require the development of new proof techniques like the potential function argument. Many open questions still remain in understanding more complex facility location models.
