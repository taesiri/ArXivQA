# [Horizontal Federated Computer Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00390)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Rapid increase in visual data poses challenges due to volume and decentralized storage across geographic locations. Consolidating data is slow, costly, and sometimes prevented by privacy regulations.
- Smartphone manufacturers like Apple and Google have abundant visual data but face constraints in optimizing training while preserving user privacy and data security.

Proposed Solution: 
- Implement federated learning for computer vision tasks to enable collaborative training without sharing raw data. Present federated implementations of object detection/recognition using Federated Faster R-CNN (FRCNN) and image segmentation using Federated Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).

Main Contributions:
- Developed FRCNN trained on 5000 COCO images for object detection and recognition in a federated setting. Show viability and benefits of federated approach for tasks needing substantial data.
- Implemented FCN trained on full CamVid dataset for federated image segmentation. Analyzed strengths and challenges compared to local models. Federated model has better understanding of shared knowledge but longer training times.
- Highlighted suitability of federated learning for computer vision when large, diverse training data is needed but cannot be consolidated due to regulations or privacy reasons. Enables optimization of model development for companies while ensuring data security and integrity.
- Discussed future work like expanding to vertical federated implementations, using Vision Transformers, and leveraging large language models adapted for computer vision.

In summary, the paper demonstrates federated learning as an effective decentralized approach for computer vision tasks needing large datasets. The solutions enable collaborative training while complying with privacy requirements.
