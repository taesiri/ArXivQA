# [All You Need is Ratings: A Clustering Approach to Synthetic Rating   Datasets Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00687)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research questions addressed in this paper are:RQ1: What is the impact of using a synthetic dataset instead of a real one on the results of an offline experiment in the context of recommender systems? RQ2: Can a generative approach be exploited to create a synthetic dataset that exhibits properties similar enough to the ones of a real dataset?RQ3: To what extend this method can be consistently applied to datasets from different domains and of different sizes?The authors propose a method to generate synthetic user rating datasets that mimic the characteristics of real datasets. They then conduct experiments to evaluate the impact of using these synthetic datasets compared to real ones for offline evaluation of recommender systems. The goal is to determine if synthetic datasets can produce evaluation results comparable to using real data.
