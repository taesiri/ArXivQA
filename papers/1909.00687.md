# [All You Need is Ratings: A Clustering Approach to Synthetic Rating   Datasets Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00687)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research questions addressed in this paper are:RQ1: What is the impact of using a synthetic dataset instead of a real one on the results of an offline experiment in the context of recommender systems? RQ2: Can a generative approach be exploited to create a synthetic dataset that exhibits properties similar enough to the ones of a real dataset?RQ3: To what extend this method can be consistently applied to datasets from different domains and of different sizes?The authors propose a method to generate synthetic user rating datasets that mimic the characteristics of real datasets. They then conduct experiments to evaluate the impact of using these synthetic datasets compared to real ones for offline evaluation of recommender systems. The goal is to determine if synthetic datasets can produce evaluation results comparable to using real data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method for automatically generating synthetic rating datasets that mimic the characteristics of existing real datasets. The key ideas are:- Perform user clustering on the real dataset to identify different user communities with distinct rating behaviors. - Learn the rating distributions per user and per item for each user cluster.- Use these learned distributions to sample ratings and generate synthetic users that belong to the different clusters.- The number of synthetic users can be configured, allowing generation of larger datasets for scalability testing.- The synthetic users do not have direct relation to real users, avoiding privacy concerns.The authors evaluate their approach by generating synthetic versions of MovieLens and LastFM datasets. They show that evaluation of recommenders on the synthetic data leads to similar relative ordering of algorithms as on the real data. This suggests the synthetic datasets capture key characteristics of real user preferences.In summary, the proposed generative approach can produce realistic synthetic rating datasets while addressing the limitations around privacy and scalability of real rating data. This could enable more rigorous offline evaluation of recommenders.
