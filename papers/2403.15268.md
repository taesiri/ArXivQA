# [Imagination Augmented Generation: Learning to Imagine Richer Context for   Question Answering over Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15268)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge-intensive tasks like question answering require access to extensive world knowledge, which large language models (LLMs) lack on their own. This causes issues like hallucinations. 
- Existing methods to enhance LLMs' knowledge, like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and generation-augmented generation (GAG), rely on external resources or generate verbose contexts, increasing computational overhead.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new framework called Imagination-Augmented Generation (IAG) that activates and utilizes LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to imagine richer contexts, without needing external resources.
- They introduce an Imagine richer context method for question answering (IMcQA) with two key modules:
   - Explicit imagination: Generates a short dummy document to provide useful context.
   - Implicit imagination: Uses a HyperNetwork to generate adapter weights that activate internal knowledge.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the novel IAG framework for efficiently enhancing LLMs' knowledge by leveraging imagination without external resources.
- Introduces the IMcQA method with explicit and implicit imagination to obtain richer context for question answering.
- Experiments show IMcQA outperforms baselines in open/closed-book QA, in-distribution and out-of-distribution, while being more parameter- and computation- efficient.
- Demonstrates the possibility of enhancing LLMs' capacity via internal knowledge activation through IAG, opening possibilities for applying this to other knowledge-intensive NLP tasks.

In summary, the key innovation is efficiently activating LLMs' internal knowledge through imagination to reduce reliance on external resources or verbose contexts for knowledge-intensive tasks. The proposed IAG framework and IMcQA method showcase improved QA performance while needing fewer parameters and computations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Imagination-Augmented Generation (IAG), a novel knowledge augmentation framework for question answering that leverages large language models' intrinsic knowledge through explicit imagination to generate a short dummy document and implicit imagination with a HyperNetwork to activate task-relevant abilities, without relying on external resources.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a new knowledge augmentation framework called Imagination-Augmented-Generation (IAG) to fully leverage the intrinsic knowledge in large language models more efficiently without relying on external resources. 

2) Proposing a novel QA method called IMcQA that employs two main modules (explicit imagination and implicit imagination) to better utilize the knowledge stored in the large language models and obtain richer context for question answering.

3) Experimental results showing that the proposed method successfully activates the relevant internal knowledge of large language models. IMcQA exhibits significant advantages in both open-domain and closed-book settings, as well as in both in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution generalizations.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this work include:

- Imagination-Augmented-Generation (IAG): The novel knowledge augmentation framework proposed that utilizes a model's intrinsic knowledge to imagine richer context for question answering.

- Explicit imagination: One of the two main modules in IAG, which generates a short dummy document to provide useful context. Uses long context compression.  

- Implicit imagination: The second main module in IAG, which uses a HyperNetwork to generate flexible adapter weights and align question representations with internal knowledge.

- Question answering (QA): The primary task focused on in this paper to demonstrate IAG. Experiments are conducted on QA datasets.

- Knowledge distillation: Used to transfer rich representations from a teacher model to the student model during training, compensating for missing knowledge.

- Internal knowledge activation: A key goal of IAG is to better activate and trigger the knowledge already present but not fully utilized within large language models.

- Efficiency: The paper demonstrates computational and efficiency advantages of IAG over retrieval and generation augmentation methods in QA.
