# [Imagination Augmented Generation: Learning to Imagine Richer Context for   Question Answering over Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15268)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge-intensive tasks like question answering require access to extensive world knowledge, which large language models (LLMs) lack on their own. This causes issues like hallucinations. 
- Existing methods to enhance LLMs' knowledge, like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and generation-augmented generation (GAG), rely on external resources or generate verbose contexts, increasing computational overhead.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new framework called Imagination-Augmented Generation (IAG) that activates and utilizes LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to imagine richer contexts, without needing external resources.
- They introduce an Imagine richer context method for question answering (IMcQA) with two key modules:
   - Explicit imagination: Generates a short dummy document to provide useful context.
   - Implicit imagination: Uses a HyperNetwork to generate adapter weights that activate internal knowledge.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the novel IAG framework for efficiently enhancing LLMs' knowledge by leveraging imagination without external resources.
- Introduces the IMcQA method with explicit and implicit imagination to obtain richer context for question answering.
- Experiments show IMcQA outperforms baselines in open/closed-book QA, in-distribution and out-of-distribution, while being more parameter- and computation- efficient.
- Demonstrates the possibility of enhancing LLMs' capacity via internal knowledge activation through IAG, opening possibilities for applying this to other knowledge-intensive NLP tasks.

In summary, the key innovation is efficiently activating LLMs' internal knowledge through imagination to reduce reliance on external resources or verbose contexts for knowledge-intensive tasks. The proposed IAG framework and IMcQA method showcase improved QA performance while needing fewer parameters and computations.
