# [Sparse Graph Representations for Procedural Instructional Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03957)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods like Joint Concept Interaction Graphs (JCIGs) model document similarity effectively for news articles. However, they do not encode sequential information which is crucial for instruction manuals, recipes, etc.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose two algorithms - Supergenome Sorting (SGS) and Hamiltonian Path (HP) - for dominant direction deduction (D3) to add directed edges that encode sequential flow.
- Apply D3 individually on concept interaction graphs or jointly on joint concept interaction graphs.  
- Sparsify the resultant directed graph to O(n) edges from O(n2) edges originally.

Key Contributions:
- Propose a direction pseudograph to add directed edges between concepts based on sentence sequence. 
- Introduce dominant direction deduction (D3) via SGS and HP algorithms to deduce the primary direction of information flow.
- Achieve graph sparsification to O(n) edges by adding dominant directions.
- Show that HP algorithm beats JCIG baseline by 10 accuracy points on instruction manual dataset which requires sequential reasoning.
- Demonstrate comparable performance to JCIG on news article datasets where sequence is not crucial.

In summary, the paper encodes sequential information in graph representations for document similarity by adding dominant directed edges via two proposed algorithms. It shows significant improvements in accuracy for instruction manuals while performing equally well for news articles.
