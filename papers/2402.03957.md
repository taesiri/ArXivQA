# [Sparse Graph Representations for Procedural Instructional Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03957)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods like Joint Concept Interaction Graphs (JCIGs) model document similarity effectively for news articles. However, they do not encode sequential information which is crucial for instruction manuals, recipes, etc.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose two algorithms - Supergenome Sorting (SGS) and Hamiltonian Path (HP) - for dominant direction deduction (D3) to add directed edges that encode sequential flow.
- Apply D3 individually on concept interaction graphs or jointly on joint concept interaction graphs.  
- Sparsify the resultant directed graph to O(n) edges from O(n2) edges originally.

Key Contributions:
- Propose a direction pseudograph to add directed edges between concepts based on sentence sequence. 
- Introduce dominant direction deduction (D3) via SGS and HP algorithms to deduce the primary direction of information flow.
- Achieve graph sparsification to O(n) edges by adding dominant directions.
- Show that HP algorithm beats JCIG baseline by 10 accuracy points on instruction manual dataset which requires sequential reasoning.
- Demonstrate comparable performance to JCIG on news article datasets where sequence is not crucial.

In summary, the paper encodes sequential information in graph representations for document similarity by adding dominant directed edges via two proposed algorithms. It shows significant improvements in accuracy for instruction manuals while performing equally well for news articles.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes algorithms to add directed edges that encode sequential information to joint concept interaction graphs for document pairs, improving performance on instructional documents while maintaining accuracy on news articles.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing two algorithms (Supergenome Sorting and Hamiltonian Path) to add directed edges to Joint Concept Interaction Graphs (JCIGs). Specifically:

- The paper argues that while JCIGs are effective at modeling document similarity for news articles, they do not encode sequential information which is important for certain document types like recipes and instruction manuals. 

- To address this limitation, the authors propose adding directed edges to JCIGs using two graph algorithms: Supergenome Sorting and Hamiltonian Path. These algorithms deduce the dominant direction of information flow between concept nodes in the graph.

- Adding these directed edges results in a sparse, directed graph that encodes sequential information while still leveraging the power of JCIGs to model document content.

- Experiments on the iFixit appliances instruction manual dataset show that the proposed Hamiltonian Path algorithm beats the JCIG baseline by 10 accuracy points by encoding sequence information.

So in summary, the main contribution is using Supergenome Sorting and Hamiltonian Path to add sparse, directed edges to JCIGs to encode sequential information while preserving the ability to match document content effectively. This results in improvements on a dataset of instruction manuals.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

The paper proposes improvements to joint concept interaction graphs (JCIGs) to incorporate sequential information by adding directed edges using two algorithms - supergenome sorting (SGS) and Hamiltonian path (HP). The sequential JCIGs are then used in a Siamese encoder and GCN architecture for document similarity computation, and evaluated on Chinese news and iFixit appliance repair manual datasets. The key focus is on encoding sequential information in graph representations for certain document types where order of information is crucial.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two algorithms for dominant direction deduction (D3) - Supergenome Sorting (SGS) and Hamiltonian Path (HP). Can you explain in detail the methodology behind each of these algorithms and how they help in adding directed edges while sparsifying the graph?

2. The paper evaluates performance on three datasets - CNSE, CNSS and iFixit. Why is sequential information not crucial for CNSE and CNSS? What characteristics of the iFixit dataset make sequential information important?

3. The first stage in the pipeline is keyword extraction using algorithms like RAKE, Summa, TextRank etc. The paper performs a manual analysis to select the best performing algorithm. Can you suggest some quantitative metrics that could have been used to automatically evaluate and select the best keyword extraction algorithm? 

4. Concept detection involves creating a keyword graph and then using community detection algorithms on it. The paper mentions that the choice of community detection algorithm does not impact performance. Can you think of some ways to further analyze the impact of different community detection algorithms?

5. Sentence assignment to concepts is done based on TF-IDF similarity between the sentence and concept representations. How does the choice of threshold similarity impact concept formation and downstream performance?

6. The paper proposes two variants of applying dominant direction deduction - Individual (I-D3) and Combined (C-D3). Why does C-D3 perform better than I-D3?

7. The match vectors generated by the Siamese encoder capture similarities and differences between sentence representations from the two documents. What are some other mechanisms to generate node representations that can encode inter-document semantics?  

8. How does sparsification of the graph using SGS and HP algorithms help in improving training and inference efficiency? Can you analyze the time and memory requirements?

9. The model uses a 3-layer GCN for document matching. How does depth of the GCN impact modeling power and training efficiency? Can you design experiments to determine the optimal number of layers?

10. The paper focuses only on the Appliances category of instruction manuals from iFixit. Do you think the performance gains will carry forward to other categories like consumer electronics, vehicles etc.? Justify your answer.
