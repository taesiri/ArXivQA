# [Designing High-Performing Networks for Multi-Scale Computer Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12536)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Object detection is an important computer vision task with applications like autonomous driving and surveillance. Two-stage object detectors consist of a region proposal network to identify object regions followed by a detection head to classify the regions and regress bounding boxes. Recently, query-based two-stage heads were proposed as an alternative but have limitations in convergence speed and handling small objects. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes FQDet and FQDetV2, new query-based two-stage object detection heads that combine strengths of classical and Transformer-based detectors. The key ideas are:

1) Introduce anchors of varying sizes/aspect ratios to improve cross-attention operation's box priors for better feature sampling. Encode boxes relative to anchors like Faster R-CNN.

2) Replace Hungarian matching used in prior works with a static top-k matching scheme for faster convergence. Matches based on IoU overlap with ground truth.

3) Simplified design without iterative bounding box regression or auxiliary losses used in prior works.

4) FQDetV2 enhances FQDet via larger query set, enhanced classification and regression networks, better losses like quality focal loss and EIoU loss.

Main Contributions:

- Propose FQDet and FQDetV2 heads combining classical and Transformer techniques 
- Show strong performance after 12/24 epochs on COCO using ResNet/Swin backbones
- Outperform state-of-the-art like Deformable DETR, DINO, Cascade RCNN
- Validate design choices through extensive ablation studies
- Analyze limitations like dataset/metric overfitting and directions for future work

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in advancing state-of-the-art for query-based two-stage object detection via a simplified and effective design.
