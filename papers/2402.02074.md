# [Multiple-Crop Human Mesh Recovery with Contrastive Learning and Camera   Consistency in A Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02074)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of single-image human mesh recovery (HMR). Existing approaches mostly rely on a single crop of the human image as input. This poses two key challenges: 1) extracting discriminative features from the single input, and 2) ambiguity in recovering the 3D mesh from the 2D image.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel multiple-crop HMR paradigm. Instead of using a single crop, it crops the human image multiple times by shifting and scaling the detected bounding box. This provides more visual details as input. The authors then propose three strategies to take advantage of the multiple crops:

1. Apply contrastive learning on the features from multiple crops to enhance similarity of features from the same human while reducing similarity between different people. This helps extract discriminative features.  

2. Propose a crop-aware fusion module to fuse features from multiple crops under guidance of relative bounding box positions. This aligns and fuses crop-specific information.

3. Compute multiple local cameras for the crops, and propose a camera consistency loss using analytically derived relations between the local cameras. This reduces camera ambiguity.

Based on these ideas, the paper proposes an end-to-end network with a shared feature encoder, the above three components, and final decoders regressing a shared 3D mesh and multiple cameras.

Main Contributions:

1. Extend the single-crop HMR paradigm to a novel multiple-crop formulation.

2. Incorporate contrastive learning, crop-aware fusion, and camera consistency loss to take advantage of multiple crops.

3. Achieve state-of-the-art performance on 3DPW and Human3.6M datasets, demonstrating effectiveness of the simple yet effective approach.

In summary, the paper tackles limitations of single-crop HMR by a new multiple-crop formulation and tailored strategies, leading to improved performance. The ideas are simple, easy to implement, yet very effective as evidenced by extensive experiments.
