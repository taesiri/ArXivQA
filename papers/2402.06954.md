# [OpenFedLLM: Training Large Language Models on Decentralized Private Data   via Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06954)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Public data for training large language models (LLMs) is getting exhausted, limiting further improvement. However, there is abundant useful private data distributed across organizations that is underutilized.  
- Training LLMs on private data in a centralized manner is infeasible due to privacy concerns and high compute requirements.

Proposed Solution: 
- Explore collaborative training of LLMs on decentralized private data via federated learning (FL).
- Focus on two key steps - federated instruction tuning to enhance instruction-following capability and federated value alignment to align models with human values.
- Build an integrated framework, OpenFedLLM, covering diverse FL algorithms, datasets, evaluation metrics to enable exploration.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive exploration of training LLMs on decentralized private data using FL. 
- Propose OpenFedLLM framework to support federated instruction tuning, value alignment and 7 FL algorithms.
- Empirical study on 8 datasets showing FL outperforms local training, e.g. 12%+ on general dataset.
- Key observation - FL tuning on finance data outperforms even GPT-4, demonstrating value of collaboration.
- Discuss emerging challenges in efficiency, security, personalization and data management for future work.

The paper makes a strong case for collaborative training of LLMs on private data via FL as an alternative to exhausting public data, enabled through the proposed OpenFedLLM framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores training large language models on decentralized private data via federated learning, proposes an integrated framework called OpenFedLLM covering diverse aspects, and provides a comprehensive empirical study demonstrating the effectiveness of collaborative training and revealing insights for future exploration.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It explores the complete pipeline for fine-tuning contemporary large language models on decentralized private data resources via federated learning, pointing out a promising development direction for LLMs in light of the gradual depletion of public data.

2. It proposes an integrated and concise framework called \texttt{OpenFedLLM} that covers applications like federated instruction tuning, federated value alignment, diverse FL algorithms, training datasets, and evaluation metrics. This framework is research-friendly for both LLMs and FL communities.  

3. It provides a comprehensive empirical analysis based on the \texttt{OpenFedLLM} framework, demonstrating that models trained by FL methods consistently outperform models trained by individual local training. For example, models fine-tuned on financial data via FL can even outperform GPT-4, showing strong motivation for organizations to participate in federated learning.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the \texttt{OpenFedLLM} framework to enable collaborative and privacy-preserving LLM training on decentralized private data, along with an extensive empirical study that demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach.
