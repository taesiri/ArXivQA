# [Automatic Model Selection with Large Language Models for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14333)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 After reviewing the paper, it appears the central research question is:

Can we improve reasoning performance by combining distinct reasoning methods through automatic model selection with large language models?

More specifically, the key points are:

- There are two effective but distinct reasoning methods: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-Aided Language Models (PAL). 

- CoT uses natural language while PAL uses Python code, and they have different strengths and weaknesses.

- The paper proposes using a large language model (LLM) to automatically select between CoT and PAL on a per-problem basis to get the best of both methods.

- Theoretically analyzes conditions for when this approach can work.

- Empirically evaluates the method on 8 reasoning datasets and shows significant improvements in accuracy.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that automatically selecting between CoT and PAL with an LLM can combine their strengths and lead to better overall reasoning performance. The theoretical and empirical results support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper appears to be proposing and demonstrating a method to combine two distinct reasoning approaches, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-Aided Language Models (PAL), by using a large language model to select the better method for each reasoning problem. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Proposing the idea of using large language models to perform automatic model selection between CoT and PAL based on their reasoning chains and results. This allows combining the strengths of both methods.

- Providing a theoretical analysis on when this approach can work or fail based on the difference between the models and the success rate of model selection. The analysis shows that perfect selection is not required for improvements.

- Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method empirically on 8 reasoning datasets, achieving consistent performance improvements using Codex, ChatGPT and GPT-4 as the selection model.

- Achieving new state-of-the-art results of 96.5% on GSM8K and 93.7% on SVAMP using the proposed model selection approach.

Overall, the main contribution is a novel and effective approach for combining distinct reasoning methods using large language models for automatic model selection, supported by theoretical analysis and strong empirical results.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is my analysis of how this paper compares to other research in the field of reasoning with large language models:

Overall Approach:
- This paper proposes combining two distinct reasoning methods, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-Aided Language Models (PAL), by using a large language model to select the best result for each problem. This is a novel approach not taken in other papers. 

- Most other work focuses on improving a single reasoning method, either by enhancing the prompt/instructions, search algorithm, or incorporating additional techniques like self-consistency. In contrast, this work explores combining multiple diverse methods.

- The most related work is Uesato et al. 2022, which trains a separate ranker model to choose between CoT and PAL results. This paper shows selection can be done simply via few-shot prompting of an LLM itself.

Technical Contributions: 
- Provides formal analysis on when combining methods can improve performance, relating it to accuracy differences and selection success probability. This theoretical grounding is unique.

- Achieves SOTA results on GSM8K and SVAMP by combining CoT and PAL. Many other papers focus on either one method or the other.

- Demonstrates consistent improvements across diverse reasoning tasks by combining CoT and PAL. Shows general applicability beyond just mathematical reasoning.

- Analyzes influencing factors clearly. Relates performance gains to accuracy gaps and selection rates. Provides intuition into why the method works.

Limitations:
- Focuses only on CoT and PAL. Could try combining other diverse reasoning methods. 

- Uses greedy decoding. Exploring stochastic/beam search could further enhance performance.

- Model selection relies solely on few-shot learning. More training data could improve selection capability.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel model combination idea and provides extensive empirical evidence along with formal analysis about its effectiveness. The simplicity of few-shot selection while still achieving SOTA results is noteworthy. The limitations provide opportunities for future work to build on these ideas. Overall, this is a strong contribution advancing the state-of-the-art in reasoning with LLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Apply the model selection framework to other domains beyond reasoning tasks. The authors focused on reasoning in this work, but suggest expanding the approach to other areas where model selection could be beneficial.

- Explore alternate methods for model collaboration beyond just selection. The authors mention that their approach of selecting between model outputs may not fully leverage the unique strengths of each model. They suggest exploring other ways for the models to collaborate.

- Investigate using diverse system instructions to elicit different model behaviors. For instance, prompting the model to provide reasoning steps with maximum or minimum detail to get different reasoning chains that could then be combined.

- Optimize the model selection more directly by minimizing the bound derived in Proposition 1. The authors suggest that their design choices indirectly optimize this bound, but propose directly minimizing it as future work.

- Improve the robustness of the approach to the prompts. The authors acknowledge the method depends on the prompt design and in-context learning.

- Integrate progress made by other reasoning methods like tree-based search, backward chaining, etc. The authors state these orthogonal improvements could complement their approach.

- Explore model selection in broader settings like open-ended dialog. The current work focuses on question answering, but model selection may be useful in other settings.

In summary, the main suggestions are to expand the approach to new domains, investigate alternate forms of model collaboration, optimize the selection objective directly, improve prompt engineering, integrate complementary reasoning innovations, and apply the ideas more broadly.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a model selection approach to combine the benefits of two distinct reasoning methods - Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-Aided Language Models (PAL). The key idea is to present an LLM with examples showing the reasoning chains from both CoT and PAL, and ask it to identify which method produces the correct reasoning for a given problem. By leveraging the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, they are able to perform model selection with high accuracy after seeing just a few examples. During test time, the LLM is prompted with a reasoning problem, and the reasoning chains generated by CoT and PAL. It then selects the chain it deems more accurate, and outputs the corresponding result. The method is evaluated on 8 reasoning datasets, and shows significant improvements over using either CoT or PAL alone. A theoretical analysis reveals the performance gain is jointly determined by the difference between the methods and the model selection accuracy.
