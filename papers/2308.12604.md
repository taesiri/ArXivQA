# [PromptMRG: Diagnosis-Driven Prompts for Medical Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12604)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to improve the diagnostic accuracy of automatic medical report generation (MRG) systems. Specifically, the paper aims to address two key challenges:1) Existing MRG systems lack the ability to generate clinically accurate reports that precisely reflect the medical abnormalities in the input images. This is a critical issue as incorrect diagnosis can lead to harmful consequences in real-world application. 2) There is an imbalanced distribution of diseases in the training data, causing poor performance on rare diseases. This further limits the reliability and usefulness of MRG systems.To tackle these issues, the paper proposes a new MRG framework called PromptMRG. The key ideas are:- Using a disease classification branch to explicitly guide the text generation process via diagnosis-driven prompts converted from the classification results. This allows incorporating diagnostic knowledge to generate clinically accurate reports.- A cross-modal feature enhancement module to improve disease classification by retrieving similar reports as extra references. - A self-adaptive disease-balanced learning technique to overcome the imbalanced disease distribution by adaptively adjusting the learning objective per disease.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by utilizing diagnosis-driven prompts and handling the class imbalance issue, the proposed PromptMRG framework can significantly improve the clinical efficacy of automatic MRG systems. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the efficacy of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a new medical report generation (MRG) framework called PromptMRG that utilizes a disease classification branch to guide report generation via token prompts converted from the diagnostic results. This allows the model to generate clinically accurate reports.2. Designing a cross-modal feature enhancement (CFE) module that enhances the visual features with retrieved similar reports for more robust disease classification, overcoming the limitation of using images alone. 3. Developing a self-adaptive disease-balanced learning (SDL) method to handle the imbalanced learning among diseases. It adaptively adjusts the optimization objective of each disease based on its unique learning status.4. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of PromptMRG on two MRG benchmarks, especially in terms of clinical efficacy metrics. The proposed modules are shown to be effective in boosting the diagnostic accuracy and handling disease imbalance.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a diagnosis-driven prompting mechanism to guide report generation for improved clinical accuracy, along with CFE and SDL to further boost the diagnostic performance. The superiority of PromptMRG is verified through extensive experiments and comparisons with prior arts.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a medical report generation framework called PromptMRG that improves diagnostic accuracy by using a disease classification branch to generate diagnosis-driven token prompts to guide the text decoder, enhances the classifier with similar reports retrieved via CLIP for robust diagnosis, and handles disease imbalance with a self-adaptive logit loss.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in medical report generation:- This paper introduces a novel prompting method to guide the text generation process using diagnostic results. Prompting has been widely used in NLP but is relatively new for medical report generation. Compared to prior work using knowledge graphs or multi-task learning, the prompting approach provides a more explicit way to leverage diagnostic information to boost clinical efficacy. - The cross-modal feature enhancement module is also innovative, as it is one of the first attempts to incorporate retrieved reports for assisting diagnosis in medical report generation. This aligns well with how radiologists make diagnoses by referencing databases. Most prior works solely rely on the image content.- Self-adaptive disease-balanced learning is proposed to address the long-standing issue of imbalanced learning across diseases. This issue has been noted before but no effective solution was proposed. By adaptively adjusting loss functions, the model is optimized in a more balanced manner.- The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art clinical efficacy results on two benchmarks MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray. The absolute improvement in F1 score is substantially higher compared to prior arts, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model in generating clinically accurate reports.- For natural language generation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, the performance is on par or slightly lower than some recent models. This indicates a trade-off between optimizing for linguistic quality and clinical accuracy, which is an interesting finding.Overall, this paper introduces effective techniques to address key challenges in medical report generation through diagnosis-driven prompting, cross-modal retrieval, and self-adaptive optimization. The techniques and superior results advance the state-of-the-art in this field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring richer and more fine-grained prompting information to improve both linguistic precision and diagnostic accuracy of the generated reports. The current token prompts used in the diagnosis-driven prompts (DDP) module convey high-level diagnostic information, but more detailed prompt design could further enhance performance. - Developing a better cross-modal retrieval module for the cross-modal feature enhancement (CFE). The current CFE relies on a pre-trained CLIP model, but a retrieval module tailored for the medical domain could retrieve more relevant reports to further boost diagnostic accuracy.- Evaluating the model on a more diverse test set. The current evaluation is primarily on chest x-rays, but testing on other modalities like CT scans could better assess the generalization ability. - Incorporating spatial information into the model architecture. The current model encodes the whole image with a CNN, but using region features could allow generating more spatially grounded descriptions.- Exploring semi-supervised or self-supervised learning to take advantage of unlabeled medical images, which are abundant in the clinical setting. This could help improve feature learning and generalization.- Investigating other decoder architectures such as Transformer to generate more fluent and coherent reports. The current RNN decoder limits long-range dependencies modeling.- Addressing the redundancy issue when converting the structured outputs from the classification branch into free-text reports. There may be repetitiveness between prompt tokens and decoded words.- Evaluating the clinical utility and physician acceptance of the generated reports through user studies in real-world settings. This is important for translating the technology to clinical practice.
