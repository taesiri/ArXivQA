# [PromptMRG: Diagnosis-Driven Prompts for Medical Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12604)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to improve the diagnostic accuracy of automatic medical report generation (MRG) systems. Specifically, the paper aims to address two key challenges:1) Existing MRG systems lack the ability to generate clinically accurate reports that precisely reflect the medical abnormalities in the input images. This is a critical issue as incorrect diagnosis can lead to harmful consequences in real-world application. 2) There is an imbalanced distribution of diseases in the training data, causing poor performance on rare diseases. This further limits the reliability and usefulness of MRG systems.To tackle these issues, the paper proposes a new MRG framework called PromptMRG. The key ideas are:- Using a disease classification branch to explicitly guide the text generation process via diagnosis-driven prompts converted from the classification results. This allows incorporating diagnostic knowledge to generate clinically accurate reports.- A cross-modal feature enhancement module to improve disease classification by retrieving similar reports as extra references. - A self-adaptive disease-balanced learning technique to overcome the imbalanced disease distribution by adaptively adjusting the learning objective per disease.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by utilizing diagnosis-driven prompts and handling the class imbalance issue, the proposed PromptMRG framework can significantly improve the clinical efficacy of automatic MRG systems. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the efficacy of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a new medical report generation (MRG) framework called PromptMRG that utilizes a disease classification branch to guide report generation via token prompts converted from the diagnostic results. This allows the model to generate clinically accurate reports.2. Designing a cross-modal feature enhancement (CFE) module that enhances the visual features with retrieved similar reports for more robust disease classification, overcoming the limitation of using images alone. 3. Developing a self-adaptive disease-balanced learning (SDL) method to handle the imbalanced learning among diseases. It adaptively adjusts the optimization objective of each disease based on its unique learning status.4. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of PromptMRG on two MRG benchmarks, especially in terms of clinical efficacy metrics. The proposed modules are shown to be effective in boosting the diagnostic accuracy and handling disease imbalance.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a diagnosis-driven prompting mechanism to guide report generation for improved clinical accuracy, along with CFE and SDL to further boost the diagnostic performance. The superiority of PromptMRG is verified through extensive experiments and comparisons with prior arts.
