# [Benchmarking LLMs on the Semantic Overlap Summarization Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17008)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Semantic Overlap Summarization (SOS) is an important constrained multi-document summarization task where the goal is to summarize the common/overlapping information between two alternative narratives.  
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in text summarization tasks but have not yet been comprehensively benchmarked on the SOS task. 
- Evaluating LLMs on this task is challenging due to sensitivity to prompt design. Small variations in prompts can lead to very different performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- Leverage the recently introduced TELeR taxonomy to systematically design a variety of prompts for the SOS task. 
- Test 15 popular LLMs with 5 different prompt types (exploring 25 unique prompts) on the SOS task using two datasets:
     1) Existing AllSides dataset 
     2) New PrivacyPolicyPairs (3P) dataset introduced in this paper
- Evaluate using metrics like ROUGE, BERTscore, SEM-F1.

Key Contributions:
- Introduction of new 3P dataset for SOS task with 135 carefully annotated alternative narrative pairs 
- First comprehensive benchmarking study of 15 LLMs on the SOS task using a systematic prompt design approach guided by the TELeR taxonomy
- Analysis of strengths and limitations of various LLMs in capturing overlapping information 
- Finding that TELeR level 1 prompts work best on average for SOS task
- Observation that 3P dataset was more challenging for LLMs than AllSides dataset

In summary, this paper significantly advances the understanding of LLMs' capabilities on the important SOS task through an extensive prompt-based benchmarking study using new datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper benchmarks 15 large language models on the semantic overlap summarization task, which involves summarizing the common information between two alternative narratives, using diverse prompts designed with the TELeR taxonomy to evaluate the models' capabilities on two datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contribution is:

A comprehensive benchmarking study evaluating 15 popular large language models (LLMs) on the task of Semantic Overlap Summarization (SOS) using two datasets - the existing AllSides dataset and a newly introduced PrivacyPolicyPairs (3P) dataset. The study utilizes the TELeR taxonomy to systematically design a variety of prompts to elicit the best performance from the LLMs on the SOS task. Key findings include: 1) The 3P dataset is more challenging for LLMs compared to AllSides; 2) TELeR level 1 prompts work best on average for the SOS task; 3) An analysis of strengths and limitations of the LLMs in capturing and synthesizing overlapping information from multiple narratives.

The paper provides a rigorous evaluation methodology and benchmark results to assess LLMs' capabilities on the important but understudied SOS task. The introduction of the new 3P dataset also expands resources for future SOS research.

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Semantic Overlap Summarization (SOS)
- Large Language Models (LLMs) 
- Benchmarking
- Prompt engineering
- TELeR taxonomy
- AllSides dataset
- PrivacyPolicyPairs (3P) dataset
- Evaluation metrics (ROUGE, BERTscore, SEM-F1)
- Analysis of LLMs' strengths and limitations in capturing overlapping information

The paper focuses on benchmarking the performance of LLMs on the Semantic Overlap Summarization task using diverse prompts designed based on the TELeR taxonomy. It utilizes two datasets - the existing AllSides dataset and a newly introduced PrivacyPolicyPairs dataset. Several evaluation metrics are reported and the strengths and weaknesses of various LLMs are analyzed in terms of their capability to summarize overlapping information from multiple documents.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper utilizes the TELeR taxonomy to design prompts for the LLMs. What are the key dimensions of this taxonomy and how do they allow for systematically exploring different prompts?

2. The paper tests two datasets - AllSides and PrivacyPolicyPairs (3P). What is the key difference between these datasets and why did the authors choose to evaluate on both? 

3. The PrivacyPolicyPairs (3P) dataset was created by the authors. Explain the process they followed to construct this dataset from the OPP-115 corpus. What strategies did they employ to ensure high quality sample pairs with overlap?

4. The paper reports lower performance on the 3P dataset compared to AllSides. Analyze potential reasons for why the 3P dataset appears to be more challenging for the LLMs.

5. The authors designed 5 variations of prompts (A-E) for each TELeR level. Discuss their procedure for final prompt selection and provide a rationale for their choice.

6. The highest scoring prompt overall was at TELeR level 1. Why do you think a simple one-sentence prompt works the best instead of more complex instructions? Provide some hypotheses.

7. Compare the relative strengths and weaknesses of commercial LLMs like GPT-3.5 against open source models like Mistral-7B in performing semantic overlap summarization based on the results.

8. The authors report that SEM-F1 consistently preferred level 4 prompts on the 3P dataset. Analyze why this discrepancy may have occurred compared to other metrics like ROUGE. 

9. Discuss potential limitations of the automated metrics used in evaluating the LLMs on the semantic overlap summarization task. Are there better alternatives?

10. The paper provides a comprehensive benchmarking study of LLMs on a relatively under-explored task. What are possible extensions of this work - either in terms of models, datasets, or applications?
