# [Japanese Tort-case Dataset for Rationale-supported Legal Judgment   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00480)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents the first dataset for Japanese Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP), called the Japanese Tort-case Dataset (JTD). The dataset features two tasks - tort prediction, which predicts whether a tort is affirmed in a case, and rationale extraction, which identifies the court's accepted arguments from the alleged arguments made by plaintiffs and defendants. The rationale extraction task is novel in the field of LJP. JTD consists of 3,477 annotated Japanese civil code judgments by 41 legal experts, resulting in 7,978 instances with 59,697 arguments from involved parties. Baseline experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed tasks. Hierarchical Transformer models using multi-task learning perform the best. Detailed error analysis by legal experts identifies insufficient inputs and complex cases as primary sources of errors, and suggests directions for future LJP research. Overall, this paper makes important contributions by releasing the first expert-annotated dataset of Japanese judgment documents for LJP tasks, conducting baseline experiments, and providing an insightful error analysis.
