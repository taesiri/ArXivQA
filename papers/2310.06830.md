# [Lemur: Harmonizing Natural Language and Code for Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06830)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we develop open-source language models with harmonized capabilities in both natural language and programming to serve as the backbone of versatile language agents?

The key hypotheses seem to be:

1) To be effective foundations for language agents, large language models need mastery of human communication/reasoning/planning through natural language capabilities, as well as grounding in relevant environments enabled by programming abilities.

2) Current open-source language models tend to specialize in either natural language or programming, lacking the balance to support language agent development. 

3) Through careful pre-training and instruction fine-tuning, it is possible to create open-source models with balanced natural language and programming proficiencies to serve as strong foundations for building capable language agents.

4) Models harmonizing natural and programming language abilities in this way will outperform existing open-source models specialized in one domain across metrics of language, programming, and agent capabilities.

The paper introduces the Lemur and Lemur-Chat models as examples of open-source models achieving this harmonization, and presents comprehensive experiments validating their versatility and performance across diverse language, programming, and agent tasks.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Lemur and Lemur-Chat, open-source language models optimized through pre-training and instruction tuning to balance natural language and programming capabilities, enabling their use as versatile language agent foundations that can reason, plan, and operate across diverse environments.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on pre-trained language models and language agents:

- Focuses on harmonizing natural language and coding capabilities in a single open-source model, unlike most prior work that specialized models in either natural language or code. Integrating both skills is vital for building versatile language agents.

- Introduces novel pre-training and instruction fine-tuning methods to balance language and code abilities in Lemur models. Most prior open-source models are either pre-trained on mostly text (e.g. Llama) or code (e.g. CodeLlama). 

- Comprehensively evaluates model capabilities as language agents in interactive scenarios, as opposed to just assessing standard text and code benchmarks. This provides more realistic insights into how models perform in agent settings.

- Benchmarks model performance in partially observable environments like CTF games and web browsing, which pose new challenges compared to fully observable question answering settings typically evaluated.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse text, code, and agent tasks among open-source models. Closes gap with proprietary models on agent abilities more than prior open-source models.

- Open-sources pre-trained models to enable further research. Most prior work focused on proprietary models not publicly available.

Overall, this work pushes forward open-source language agent research by highlighting the need to unify natural language and coding skills. The pre-training and evaluation methodologies help validate models for practical agent applications in the real world. The gains over prior open-source models also suggest avenues to continue improving versatile agent foundations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Further explore the synergy between natural language and programming language capabilities in language models to develop more advanced language agents. The authors highlight the importance of balancing these capabilities, but there is still room to optimize this synergy. 

- Conduct more research into how to best represent actions and environment interactions for language agents. The authors found improved performance by mapping actions to a Python representation rather than just predicting actions directly. More work can be done on identifying optimal intermediate representations.

- Expand the range of tasks and environments used to evaluate language agent capabilities. The authors evaluated on a diverse set of tasks, but note that there are opportunities to assess abilities in even more complex, real-world scenarios.

- Investigate how to efficiently scale up harmonized language models like Lemur to even larger model sizes. The authors use a 70B parameter model as their base, but it would be interesting to see if benefits extend to models with trillions of parameters.

- Explore approaches for continually learning and expanding the knowledge of language agent models like Lemur. The pre-training and fine-tuning provides a strong foundation, but dynamic learning abilities could make agents more adaptable.

- Study methods to make language agent models like Lemur more robust, reliable, and safe when deployed in real-world applications. This could involve techniques to improve generalization, avoid harmful behaviors, and provide explanations.

- Develop more sophisticated evaluation frameworks that can precisely diagnose language agent capabilities and limitations. The authors provide comprehensive analysis, but even more rigorous benchmarking procedures could further advance progress.

In summary, the key directions are improving language-code synergy, representation learning, task diversity, scalability, continual learning, robustness, and evaluation rigor for advancing language agent models.

 Here is a two-paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Lemur and Lemur-Chat, openly accessible language models optimized for both natural language and coding capabilities. The goal is to serve as the backbone of versatile language agents that can reason, plan, and operate seamlessly across environments. The evolution from chat models to functional agents demands mastery of human interaction, reasoning, and planning, as well as grounding in relevant environments.
