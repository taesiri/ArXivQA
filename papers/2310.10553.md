# [TacticAI: an AI assistant for football tactics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10553)

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using graph neural networks and geometric deep learning as part of the TacticAI framework. How exactly does the geometric deep learning component help to improve the model's performance and ability to learn useful representations? Can you provide more details on the specific geometric deep learning techniques used?

2. The paper evaluates TacticAI on three main tasks - receiver prediction, shot prediction, and guided generation for position/velocity adjustments. For the shot prediction task, conditioning the model on the predicted receiver provides better performance compared to direct unconditional shot prediction. What are some possible reasons for this improvement? Does it indicate any limitations of the unconditional model?

3. For the guided generation task, the paper uses a conditional variational autoencoder approach. What are the benefits of using a VAE framework compared to other conditional generative modeling approaches? How does the reparameterization trick help during training?

4. The ablation studies compare GATv2 models with and without group convolutions for incorporating symmetries. What are some key benefits of using group convolutions to encode symmetries instead of simpler approaches like frame averaging? Are there any downsides or limitations?

5. The paper mentions using attention mechanisms in the graph neural networks. How many attention heads are used? Is there any analysis on the impact of different numbers of heads? What role does the attention play in the model?

6. What are some of the key differences between the encoder architectures used for the predictive tasks (receiver prediction, shot prediction) versus the generative guided generation task? Why are these architectural differences necessary?

7. For the guided generation task, how does the model ensure that the generated position and velocity adjustments are realistic and smooth over time? Does it take into account any temporal dependencies or enforce smoothness constraints?

8. The case study involves both quantitative evaluation and qualitative analysis by domain experts. What are some of the key benefits of combining these two evaluation approaches? What insights can be gained from the human expert evaluation that are difficult to extract from pure quantitative metrics?

9. The paper focuses on modeling corner kicks but mentions the framework could generalize to other set pieces. What modifications would be needed to apply TacticAI to other set pieces like free kicks or penalties? What new challenges might arise?

10. For practical deployment, what are some key challenges and limitations that would need to be addressed? For example, how could the system handle noisy or incomplete input data? How might the coaches interact with and provide feedback to the system?


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is how to develop an AI system to assist football coaches with analysing and designing tactics, specifically for corner kicks. The paper proposes an AI system called TacticAI to address this question. The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Representing football tactics as graphs, with players as nodes and their relationships as edges, is an effective way to model tactics for machine learning. 

2) Applying geometric deep learning techniques like group convolutions to these graph representations can help the model learn symmetries and invariances of football tactics.

3) The predictive components of TacticAI (receiver and shot prediction) can accurately forecast tactical outcomes on real football data.

4) The generative component of TacticAI can produce realistic adjustments to tactics that are useful for coaches. 

5) TacticAI's learned representations of tactics can be used to retrieve similar historical tactics from a database.

The authors design TacticAI with predictive, generative, and retrieval capabilities to test these hypotheses, and evaluate the system both quantitatively on football tracking data and qualitatively via a case study with domain experts. The key conclusion is that TacticAI shows promise as an AI assistant for analysing and improving football tactics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper seem to be:

1. It proposes TacticAI, an AI assistant for football tactics, with a focus on analyzing and improving corner kick routines. 

2. TacticAI has both predictive components (for receiver and shot prediction) and a generative component (for guided generation of player adjustments). It can provide recommendations to coaches on how to improve corner kick tactics.

3. The predictive components achieve good accuracy on held-out test data for predicting corner kick receivers and whether a shot will occur. 

4. The generative component produces realistic player adjustments that are favored over existing tactics 90% of the time in a qualitative study with football experts.

5. TacticAI represents each situation as a graph and uses geometric deep learning, which provides efficiency and robustness despite having limited training data.

6. The utility and realism of TacticAI's outputs are validated through a comprehensive case study with football experts from Liverpool FC across several different tasks.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing and evaluating an AI assistant that can provide useful recommendations for improving corner kick tactics, validated by football experts, using graph representation learning and geometric deep learning for data efficiency.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes TacticAI, an AI assistant that helps football coaches analyze and improve corner kick tactics by predicting outcomes like receivers and shots, retrieving similar historical corners, and generating adjusted player positions to alter shot probability.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents an AI system called TacticAI to help design and analyze football tactics, with a focus on corner kicks. Here are some key ways it compares to other related work:

- It combines predictive modeling (e.g. predicting receivers, shot probabilities) with generative modeling (suggesting tactical position adjustments) in one system. Other work has tended to focus on one or the other. This allows TacticAI to not just analyze tactics but also generate suggestions.

- It represents each football situation as a graph, with players as nodes and relationships as edges. This allows the use of powerful graph neural network architectures. Other work has used spatio-temporal data in different forms like raw tracking data or video. The graph representation is flexible and capture relational information well.

- It incorporates geometric deep learning and symmetries of the football pitch into the model architecture. This provides useful inductive biases and makes the model more data efficient. Other models have not explicitly encoded these symmetries.

- It is evaluated on real tactical data from Liverpool FC, demonstrating accuracy on prediction tasks and usefulness judged by football experts. Much prior work has evaluated on public datasets which may lack real strategic richness. The real-world evaluation is a strong point.

- The focus on corner kicks specifically is fairly novel, as they provide a constrained situation with clear coaching intervention points. Most prior work looks at more general in-play situations.

Overall, the combination of predictive and generative modeling, graph representation learning, and real-world evaluation with tactical data makes this work stand out. It demonstrates AI can be an effective tactical assistant for key football situations like corner kicks. The approaches could likely generalize to other set pieces as well.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Leveraging natural language interfaces to allow for more domain-grounded conversations with the TacticAI assistant. The authors suggest developing capabilities for retrieving particular situations of interest, making predictions for given tactical variants, comparing/contrasting tactics, and interactively guiding the derivation of new tactical suggestions. This could enhance the utility of the system.

- Incorporating exogenous (aleatoric) uncertainty estimates into the model predictions and analysis. The authors note that providing uncertainty information alongside the tactical recommendations could give valuable context to football analysts. 

- Generalizing the approach to other set pieces beyond just corner kicks, such as free kicks, penalties, etc. The authors suggest the overall methodology could extend to these other structured plays.

- Applying the techniques to other team sports beyond just football/soccer. The representation learning and generative modeling approach may be relevant for sports like basketball, hockey, rugby, etc. 

- Using noisier/lower-quality tracking data derived from broadcast video instead of specialized tracking systems. This could increase the amount of training data and reach of the methods. Robustness to noise would need to be addressed.

- Retrieving more than just the top-1 similar corner kick when doing similarity search. Analysts may want to analyze 10-20 highly similar cases, which the learned representations could enable.

- Incorporating more detailed player profiling beyond just height and weight. Additional player attributes like speed, agility, position, etc. could further inform the tactical modeling and adjustment suggestions.

In summary, enhancing the interactivity, generality, uncertainty characterization, data sources, retrieval breadth, and player modeling seem to be promising areas for extending this research according to the authors. The paper lays a solid foundation on which many future improvements can build.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes TacticAI, an AI assistant for football tactics with a focus on corner kicks. TacticAI has predictive and generative components to help coaches analyze and improve corner kick routines. It represents each corner kick situation as a graph with players as nodes and builds player representations using graph neural networks and geometric deep learning. This allows it to predict outcomes like receivers and shots and generate adjustments to player positions/velocities to modify the probability of a shot. The authors evaluate TacticAI on predicting receivers and shots, guided generation of player adjustments, and through a case study with football experts from Liverpool FC. Results show it can accurately predict receivers and shots, generate realistic and useful tactical suggestions indistinguishable from real data, and offers an effective corner kick retrieval system based on its latent representations. The case study found experts significantly favored TacticAI's tactical adjustments over existing tactics. Overall, TacticAI provides a useful AI assistant for analyzing and improving football tactics.
