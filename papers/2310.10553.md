## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using graph neural networks and geometric deep learning as part of the TacticAI framework. How exactly does the geometric deep learning component help to improve the model's performance and ability to learn useful representations? Can you provide more details on the specific geometric deep learning techniques used?

2. The paper evaluates TacticAI on three main tasks - receiver prediction, shot prediction, and guided generation for position/velocity adjustments. For the shot prediction task, conditioning the model on the predicted receiver provides better performance compared to direct unconditional shot prediction. What are some possible reasons for this improvement? Does it indicate any limitations of the unconditional model?

3. For the guided generation task, the paper uses a conditional variational autoencoder approach. What are the benefits of using a VAE framework compared to other conditional generative modeling approaches? How does the reparameterization trick help during training?

4. The ablation studies compare GATv2 models with and without group convolutions for incorporating symmetries. What are some key benefits of using group convolutions to encode symmetries instead of simpler approaches like frame averaging? Are there any downsides or limitations?

5. The paper mentions using attention mechanisms in the graph neural networks. How many attention heads are used? Is there any analysis on the impact of different numbers of heads? What role does the attention play in the model?

6. What are some of the key differences between the encoder architectures used for the predictive tasks (receiver prediction, shot prediction) versus the generative guided generation task? Why are these architectural differences necessary?

7. For the guided generation task, how does the model ensure that the generated position and velocity adjustments are realistic and smooth over time? Does it take into account any temporal dependencies or enforce smoothness constraints?

8. The case study involves both quantitative evaluation and qualitative analysis by domain experts. What are some of the key benefits of combining these two evaluation approaches? What insights can be gained from the human expert evaluation that are difficult to extract from pure quantitative metrics?

9. The paper focuses on modeling corner kicks but mentions the framework could generalize to other set pieces. What modifications would be needed to apply TacticAI to other set pieces like free kicks or penalties? What new challenges might arise?

10. For practical deployment, what are some key challenges and limitations that would need to be addressed? For example, how could the system handle noisy or incomplete input data? How might the coaches interact with and provide feedback to the system?
