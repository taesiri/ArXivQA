# [NESTLE: a No-Code Tool for Statistical Analysis of Legal Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04146)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a no-code tool that allows for customizable, large-scale statistical analysis of legal corpora without needing to write any code? The key components of this question are:1) Developing a no-code tool - The goal is to create a system that does not require users to write any code themselves.2) Customizable analysis - The tool should allow users to customize the analysis by searching for documents, defining information to extract, etc. based on their specific interests. 3) Large-scale analysis - The goal is to enable analysis of large legal corpora, not just small sample sets.4) Statistical analysis - The tool aims to support statistical analysis like calculating averages or frequencies over the extracted/structured data.5) Legal corpora - The focus is on analyzing collections of legal documents like court cases and rulings.So in summary, the central research question is how to design a no-code tool that lets users conduct customizable, large-scale statistical analysis of legal corpora without programming expertise. The paper seems to focus on developing and evaluating such a tool.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:1. The development of Nestle, a no-code tool for statistical analysis of legal corpus. Nestle allows users to search and extract information from legal documents, and visualize statistics over the extracted structured data, all through a conversational interface. 2. The use of a custom end-to-end information extraction system in Nestle which enables fast and low-cost extraction compared to commercial LLMs when applied to large corpora. The IE system can be trained with just a few manually labeled examples augmented with additional examples labeled by the LLMs.3. Extensive validation of Nestle on 15 Korean legal IE tasks and 3 English legal text classification tasks. The results show that Nestle can achieve accuracy comparable to GPT-4 with just 4 manually labeled and 192 LLM-labeled examples.4. Analysis of the tradeoffs between accuracy, cost, and time when using Nestle versus purely LLM-based approaches. This analysis shows Nestle becomes orders of magnitude cheaper and faster at industrial corpus scale due to the hybrid LLM + custom IE approach.In summary, the main contribution is the development and validation of Nestle, a no-code legal corpus analysis tool that enables fast, low-cost, and customizable statistical analysis of legal texts through a combination of conversational interface, end-to-end IE, and LLMs. The tradeoff analysis also provides insights into the benefits of a hybrid LLM+IE approach compared to pure LLM methods.
