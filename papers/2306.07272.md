# [Zero-shot Composed Text-Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07272)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be: 

How can we automatically construct datasets and develop models for composed image retrieval in a zero-shot learning setting, where the model is trained on constructed datasets and evaluated directly on downstream benchmarks without additional fine-tuning?

Specifically, the key research questions/contributions seem to be:

- Can we automatically construct large-scale datasets suitable for training composed image retrieval models, without expensive manual annotation? The paper explores constructing datasets by editing image captions using templates or large language models and retrieving target images.

- Can a transformer-based model with simple but efficient fusion mechanisms work well for composed image retrieval when trained on such auto-constructed datasets? The paper proposes TransAgg model with adaptive aggregation for fusing information across modalities. 

- How does the model perform in zero-shot evaluation on existing benchmarks compared to prior state-of-the-art? The paper shows their method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on CIRR and FashionIQ datasets under zero-shot setting.

- How useful are the different components of the data construction pipeline and model architecture through ablation studies? The paper validates the effectiveness of various design choices.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is around developing scalable zero-shot learning methods for composed image retrieval via automatic dataset construction and an effective fusion-based neural model. The results seem to validate their proposed approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Proposing a retrieval-based pipeline to automatically construct datasets for training composed image retrieval (CIR) models, using easily acquired image-caption data from the internet. Specifically, they obtain two different CIR datasets by editing captions using templates or large language models. 

2. Introducing a transformer-based adaptive aggregation model called TransAgg that employs a simple yet efficient mechanism to dynamically fuse information from different modalities.

3. Conducting extensive experiments to evaluate the applicability of their constructed datasets with different pre-trained backbones and fine-tuning techniques. They also perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the transformer module and adaptive aggregation of their model.

4. Comparing their approach with existing methods on two public benchmarks (CIRR and FashionIQ) under a zero-shot scenario. Their model performs on par with or significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art models, and is sometimes comparable to fully supervised methods.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing an automated pipeline for CIR dataset construction and an effective TransAgg model for zero-shot composed image retrieval, which achieves strong performance compared to existing approaches. The ablation studies also validate the usefulness of their proposed techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for zero-shot composed image retrieval by automatically constructing training datasets from image-text pairs and introducing a transformer-based model with adaptive aggregation that achieves strong performance without finetuning on target datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of composed image retrieval:

- The paper introduces a new approach for automatically constructing training datasets for composed image retrieval models, without requiring manual annotation of triplets. This makes the process much more scalable compared to prior work that relies on manually collecting and annotating training data.

- The proposed model, TransAgg, uses a simple yet effective adaptive aggregation mechanism to fuse information from different modalities. This is in contrast to some prior works like TIRG and CIRPLANT that use more complex fusion architectures. The results seem to suggest that TransAgg's simpler approach works well.

- The paper evaluates the approach in a zero-shot setting by training only on the automatically constructed datasets and directly evaluating on public benchmarks. This is different from most prior works that train in a fully supervised manner. The zero-shot results are quite competitive, demonstrating the generalization ability.

- Compared to some other concurrent zero-shot CIR papers like Pic2Word and CompoDiff, this work does not require additional unlabeled image data or millions of synthesized triplets. The training data requirements are much more modest.

- The retrieval performance on CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks are state-of-the-art or highly competitive among zero-shot approaches. For CIRR, the results surpass all other zero-shot methods. For FashionIQ, it achieves the 2nd best results after CompoDiff, but requires much less training data.

- The zero-shot results are fairly close to some fully supervised approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed data construction and TransAgg model. For example, on CIRR, it outperforms the supervised CLRPLANT and ARTEMIS models.

In summary, the paper introduces a more scalable way to construct training data and an effective yet simple model for zero-shot CIR. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance compared to other recent zero-shot and even supervised methods. The approach helps advance zero-shot transfer learning for this task.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing better ways to represent and manipulate visual concepts and attributes. The authors note that a key limitation in composed image retrieval is the inability to precisely control visual attributes like color, texture, shape, etc. Advancing techniques for fine-grained visual concept representation and manipulation could significantly improve performance on this task.

- Exploring different model architectures and training techniques. The paper mainly focuses on transformer-based models trained with a batch classification loss. The authors suggest exploring other model architectures like graph neural networks as well as different training techniques like reinforcement learning could be promising future directions.

- Leveraging external knowledge. The authors note that integrating external knowledge sources like semantic hierarchies, commonsense knowledge bases, etc. could help models better understand the underlying concepts and semantics for composed image retrieval.

- Moving beyond categorical edits. Most existing work focuses on categorical changes like adding/removing objects. The authors suggest supporting more complex edits like positional or relationship changes could be an interesting direction.

- Studying the editable limits of current models. The authors suggest systematically evaluating where today's models fail in terms of editability could reveal fruitful opportunities for future work.

- Generalizing to other modalities and tasks. The authors suggest exploring how the ideas proposed could generalize to video retrieval, 3D scene manipulation, dialogue systems, etc.

So in summary, the key future directions highlighted are: better visual concept representation and manipulation, exploring model architectures and training techniques, integrating external knowledge, supporting more complex edits, studying model limitations, and generalizing across modalities and tasks. Advances in these areas could significantly advance composed image retrieval capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for zero-shot composed image retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve a target image that matches a reference image combined with a text description of desired modifications to that image. The key ideas are: 1) They introduce an automated pipeline to construct training datasets by retrieving suitable target images from a large pool using sentence embeddings of edited reference captions. This avoids the need for expensive manual labeling. 2) They propose a transformer-based model called TransAgg that fuses visual and text features through a Transformer module and adaptive aggregation. 3) They show through experiments that models trained on their automatic datasets alone, without any downstream dataset finetuning, can achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results on public benchmarks CIRR and FashionIQ compared to existing methods, even those trained on much larger labeled datasets. The zero-shot performance is sometimes even comparable to fully supervised methods. Overall, this is a scalable and effective approach for zero-shot composed image retrieval.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a transformer-based approach for zero-shot composed image retrieval. The key idea is to automatically construct training datasets by editing image captions using templates or large language models, then retrieve target images using the edited captions. This allows composing large datasets for training without expensive manual annotation. 

The proposed model, called TransAgg, uses pretrained encoders to extract image and text features. These features are fused using a transformer module. An adaptive aggregation module combines the fused features to create the final query embedding. Extensive experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ datasets demonstrate that TransAgg achieves state-of-the-art results under zero-shot evaluation, despite being trained on automatically constructed datasets. Ablation studies validate the contribution of the transformer fusion and adaptive aggregation modules. Qualitative results illustrate the model's ability to perform fine-grained image retrieval guided by the composed text query. Overall, this work presents a scalable pipeline for zero-shot CIR training and an effective fusion model that generalizes well without target dataset finetuning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an approach for zero-shot composed image retrieval (CIR) by automatically constructing training datasets from image-text pairs and introducing a transformer-based adaptive aggregation model called TransAgg. To construct the training data, they take image-caption pairs from Laion-COCO and generate edited captions using either templates or language models like ChatGPT. These edited captions are then used to retrieve target images with similar captions, resulting in image triplets of reference image, edited caption, and target image. The TransAgg model consists of encoders to extract visual and textual features, a Transformer module to model interactions between modalities, and an adaptive aggregation module to fuse them. The encoders are pretrained models like BLIP or CLIP. The Transformer captures cross-modality dynamics. The aggregation module uses projected weights to combine global visual, textual and fused features into a composed query embedding. The model is trained with a batch-based classification loss and evaluated in a zero-shot manner on CIRR and FashionIQ datasets, outperforming prior state-of-the-art approaches.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It addresses the problem of composed image retrieval (CIR), where the goal is to retrieve an image by providing a reference image and a text description that specifies desired modifications to that image. 

- Manually creating datasets of image triplets (reference image, text description, target image) for training CIR models is cumbersome and costly. So the paper proposes a method to automatically construct such datasets from existing image-caption pairs.

- Two approaches are presented for automatically generating the text descriptions: a template-based approach using predefined rules/templates, and a language model-based approach using ChatGPT prompts. 

- A new CIR model called TransAgg is introduced, which uses a transformer module and adaptive aggregation to fuse information from the visual and textual modalities.

- Experiments show their automatically constructed datasets can be used to train the TransAgg model, which achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on CIR benchmarks compared to recent methods, despite using far less training data.

In summary, the key questions addressed are: 1) How to efficiently create training data for CIR models? 2) How to effectively fuse visual and textual information for CIR? The main contributions are the proposed automatic dataset construction pipeline and the TransAgg fusion model for CIR.
