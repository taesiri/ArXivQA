# [Analysing and Organising Human Communications for AI Fairness-Related   Decisions: Use Cases from the Public Sector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00022)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI algorithms used in public sectors (e.g. for allocating benefits or predicting fraud) involve multiple stakeholders, leading to communication issues that can cause misinterpretation and misuse. 
- A solely technical approach to AI fairness is insufficient - involving diverse actors across an algorithm's life-cycle is important to ensure public interests are prioritized and potential harms minimized.

Objectives:  
- Identify the roles, divisions of tasks, required skills and communication challenges between stakeholders making "fairness-related decisions" about AI systems in public sectors. 
- Formulate these elements and challenges in a conceptual framework to represent communication patterns and gaps.

Methodology:
- 11 semi-structured interviews with practitioners working on public sector AI systems in the Netherlands.
- Qualitative coding analysis to identify key elements (roles, tasks, skills, challenges etc.) underlying communication processes and fairness decisions.
- Conceptual framework built from codes to model communication patterns, including missing elements like lacking skills or collaborators.  

Key Findings:
- Developers play prominent roles across most phases while lacking guidance from advisors and policymakers with domain expertise.  
- End-users and policymakers often lack technical skills to interpret system limitations/uncertainty and rely on developers for decisions.
- Citizens are structurally absent across the life-cycle, risking unbalanced fairness decisions.

Conceptual Framework:
- Models 6 key concepts (Actors, Roles, Skills, Tasks, Phases, Information Exchange) and relations between them.
- Can specify missing elements to represent communication challenges.
- Used to formulate 3 key communication patterns showing deficiencies in current governance and ability to recognize/address fairness issues.

Contributions: 
- Methodology to study communication processes underlying fairness decisions in AI systems.
- Conceptual framework to model deficiencies in these processes.
- Evidence of inadequate governance, interpretation issues and lack of citizen involvement in public sector AI.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates communication patterns between stakeholders involved in developing and deploying algorithmic systems in the public sector, finding that developers play an outsized role while domain experts and impacted citizens lack involvement, resulting in potential issues around fairness, accountability, and transparency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is:

1) Conducting semi-structured interviews with public sector practitioners working on algorithmic systems to identify key elements of the communication processes that underlie fairness-related human decisions, including the roles, divisions of tasks, required skills, and perceived challenges.

2) Analyzing the interview data through qualitative coding to categorize the communication patterns and challenges. 

3) Constructing a conceptual framework with 6 key elements (Phase, Role, Task, Skill, Actor, Information Exchange) to represent the relationships in the communication patterns, including missing elements.  

4) Applying the conceptual framework to the interview data to identify and formalize three key observations: 

(i) Developers play a prominent role but may lack guidance from domain experts 

(ii) End-users/policy-makers lack technical skills to interpret system limitations 

(iii) Citizens are structurally absent throughout the system life-cycle

In summary, the main contribution is using qualitative methods and a conceptual framework to elicit and analyze the communication processes underlying fairness-related decisions in algorithmic systems, identifying key issues such as imbalance of roles, missing skills, and lack of stakeholder involvement.

The paper investigates the communication processes between stakeholders involved in developing and using algorithmic systems in the public sector. It identifies the roles, tasks, skills, and challenges throughout the phases of an algorithm's life-cycle when making fairness-related decisions. The key findings indicate issues with involvement of certain stakeholders, interpretation of systems, and oversight of risks. The conceptual framework represents these elements of communication patterns and allows to specify missing elements. The key terms reflect the methodology and main topics covered in analyzing fairness issues from a communication perspective between stakeholders.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methodology proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a repository of use cases provided by the Dutch Ministry of Interior Affairs to recruit participants. What criteria were used to select specific use cases and participants from this repository? How might this impact the generalizability of the results?

2. The paper categorizes roles quite broadly (e.g. developer, manager). Could a more granular analysis of specific job titles under these roles reveal different communication patterns? For example, do software engineers communicate differently than data scientists? 

3. The conceptual framework links tasks to the phases of the system life-cycle. However, some tasks like fairness analysis may span multiple phases. How could the framework be adapted to capture cross-phase tasks? 

4. The paper finds developers are overrepresented across most tasks/phases. Did the interview questions presume developers would be discussed more due to a technical focus? How do we know if other roles are underrepresented?

5. Information exchange is used to capture communication transfers between actors. However, the quality and impact of information exchange could differ. Should the framework incorporate attributes to qualify information flows?

6. The framework currently does not model hierarchical relationships between actors and roles. How could hierarchy be incorporated to reveal power imbalances in communication patterns?  

7. The paper interviews practitioners in the Netherlands working in the social domain. What elements of the methodology may need to change to study other geographical contexts and system domains? 

8. While highlighting missing skills, could the framework also capture skills actors do have to provide a more complete competency mapping? 

9. The paper finds citizens are often excluded. Could citizen roles be expanded, e.g. to community representatives, to reveal varieties of public participation?

10. The paper links technical decisions to fairness implications in patterns 1 and 2. Should the framework model second-order effects to formally capture such links?
