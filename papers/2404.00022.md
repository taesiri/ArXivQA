# [Analysing and Organising Human Communications for AI Fairness-Related   Decisions: Use Cases from the Public Sector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00022)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI algorithms used in public sectors (e.g. for allocating benefits or predicting fraud) involve multiple stakeholders, leading to communication issues that can cause misinterpretation and misuse. 
- A solely technical approach to AI fairness is insufficient - involving diverse actors across an algorithm's life-cycle is important to ensure public interests are prioritized and potential harms minimized.

Objectives:  
- Identify the roles, divisions of tasks, required skills and communication challenges between stakeholders making "fairness-related decisions" about AI systems in public sectors. 
- Formulate these elements and challenges in a conceptual framework to represent communication patterns and gaps.

Methodology:
- 11 semi-structured interviews with practitioners working on public sector AI systems in the Netherlands.
- Qualitative coding analysis to identify key elements (roles, tasks, skills, challenges etc.) underlying communication processes and fairness decisions.
- Conceptual framework built from codes to model communication patterns, including missing elements like lacking skills or collaborators.  

Key Findings:
- Developers play prominent roles across most phases while lacking guidance from advisors and policymakers with domain expertise.  
- End-users and policymakers often lack technical skills to interpret system limitations/uncertainty and rely on developers for decisions.
- Citizens are structurally absent across the life-cycle, risking unbalanced fairness decisions.

Conceptual Framework:
- Models 6 key concepts (Actors, Roles, Skills, Tasks, Phases, Information Exchange) and relations between them.
- Can specify missing elements to represent communication challenges.
- Used to formulate 3 key communication patterns showing deficiencies in current governance and ability to recognize/address fairness issues.

Contributions: 
- Methodology to study communication processes underlying fairness decisions in AI systems.
- Conceptual framework to model deficiencies in these processes.
- Evidence of inadequate governance, interpretation issues and lack of citizen involvement in public sector AI.
