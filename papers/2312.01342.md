# [Graph Coordinates and Conventional Neural Networks -- An Alternative for   Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01342)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have limitations in efficiency of capturing topological information, propagating information over long distances, and high computational resource requirements.
- Existing graph embedding methods combined with neural networks are not competitive alternatives to GNNs due to limitations in capturing local and global graph structure.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce Topology Coordinate Neural Networks (TCNN) and Directional Virtual Coordinate Neural Networks (DVCNN) using two graph coordinate systems - Topology Coordinates (TC) and Directional Virtual Coordinates (DVC).
- These coordinates effectively capture local and global graph topology with fewer samples of node distances instead of full graph structure. 
- The coordinates are then combined with node features and input to conventional neural networks, avoiding intensive message passing of GNNs.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate TC and DVC can efficiently capture graph topology with low approximation error based on metrics like ambiguous edges and identical coordinates.
- TCNN and DVCNN achieve competitive or better performance compared to GNN methods on OGBN benchmark datasets while using far fewer trainable parameters. 
- For similar accuracy, proposed methods use lowest number of parameters on OGBN leaderboard.
- Conversely, for similar number of parameters, proposed methods achieve better accuracy than other methods.
- Proposed graph coordinate embedding opens up efficient use of graph topology information with various non-GNN models.
- Lower parameters enable applicability in resource-constrained environments like mobile and IoT devices.

In summary, the paper proposes TCNN and DVCNN methods using efficient graph coordinate embeddings as effective alternatives to computationally intensive GNNs for node property prediction tasks.
