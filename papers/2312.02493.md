# [Flexible Communication for Optimal Distributed Learning over   Unpredictable Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02493)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new gradient compression technique called AR-Topk that is compatible with Allreduce collective communication. Two variants of AR-Topk are presented - staleness-based (STAR-Topk) and variance-based (VAR-Topk) - which differ in how they select the worker that broadcasts compressed gradients to other workers. The paper analyzes the communication cost tradeoffs between using Allgather versus AR-Topk with either ring or tree reduction, showing that the optimal choice depends on factors like model size, compression ratio, network latency and bandwidth. A flexible communication strategy is then proposed that dynamically switches between Allgather and AR-Topk based on which incurs lower overhead. To balance parallel and statistical efficiency, the paper formulates gradient compression as a multi-objective optimization problem that aims to minimize compression and communication time while maximizing compression gain. Adaptively adjusting the compression ratio throughout training based on this formulation is shown to achieve better accuracy than fixed compression ratios. The paper also demonstrates how to select between ring or tree reduction for AR-Topk based on network conditions. Overall, the proposed techniques provide an efficient way to train deep learning models over unpredictable networks with dynamic compression and optimal communication collectives.
