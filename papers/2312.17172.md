# [Unified-IO 2: Scaling Autoregressive Multimodal Models with Vision,   Language, Audio, and Action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17172)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Building large multimodal models (LMMs) that can encode and generate multiple modalities like text, images, audio, video, and robot actions is extremely challenging. Prior works have limitations in the breadth of supported modalities and tasks or rely on initializing with a pre-trained language model, which makes training reproduceability difficult.  

Proposed Solution: This paper introduces Unified-IO 2 (\uiot), an autoregressive transformer model trained from scratch on a diverse multimodal dataset to support encoding and generating text, images, audio, video, and robot actions. Key contributions include:

1) A unified input-output representation to handle different modalities with a single model, using byte-pair encoding for text, VQGAN for images, spectrogram VQGAN for audio, etc.

2) A multimodal mixture of denoisers training objective that combines masked reconstruction and generation across modalities.

3) Architectural improvements like 2D rotary embeddings, QK normalization, and scaled cosine attention to stabilize multimodal training.  

4) An efficient dynamic packing algorithm that significantly improves training throughput.

5) Pre-training on a 1.1 billion image-text pairs, 1 trillion text tokens, 180 million video clips and other multimodal data.

6) Instruction tuning on an ensemble of over 120 datasets and 220 tasks to equip the model with diverse skills.

The 7 billion parameter \uiot model achieves SOTA on the GRIT benchmark and strong performance on over 35 other datasets, showcasing an exceptional ability to perform vision, language, audio, video, and robot instruction following with a single model.

In summary, this paper makes significant progress towards building large multimodal models that can parse and produce multiple modalities in a unified manner. The architectural innovations, efficient training techniques, and extensive multimodal pre-training and instruction tuning enable the proposed \uiot model to achieve strong empirical results across a remarkably broad set of tasks.
