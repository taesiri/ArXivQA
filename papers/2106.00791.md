# DYPLOC: Dynamic Planning of Content Using Mixed Language Models for Text   Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an effective framework for dynamic content planning and long-form opinion text generation using mixed language models?The key points are:- Existing neural text generation models struggle with coherence and lack efficient content control/planning, especially for long-form opinion articles.- Opinion text generation needs diverse types of information (subjective and objective) to guide the generator to cover relevant content.- The authors propose a new framework called DYPLOC that conducts dynamic planning of content during text generation using mixed language models.- DYPLOC takes as input a set of unordered content items containing entities, concepts, and claims. It expands the concepts using a pre-trained BART model and generates claims using another BART model.- During decoding, DYPLOC selects which content items to reflect at each step based on a learned plan scoring module, and predicts the next word based on probabilities marginalized over the mixed language models.- Experiments on argument generation (with Reddit CMV data) and opinion article writing (with NYT data) show DYPLOC outperforms competitive baselines on both automatic metrics and human evaluation.In summary, the central hypothesis is that integrating dynamic content planning through mixed language models, along with expanding the input concepts and claims, will improve coherence, content coverage, and quality for long-form opinion text generation. The results generally validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the proposal of a novel text generation framework called DYPLOC that can dynamically plan content while generating output text. The key ideas include:- Using mixed language models conditioned on multiple content items to allow flexible content selection and ordering during decoding. This overcomes limitations of previous approaches that rely solely on attention or decouple planning and generation.- Designing content items to cover entities, concepts, and claims to incorporate both objective and subjective information. Additional concepts and claims are generated to enrich the content. - Applying the framework to two challenging opinion text generation tasks - argument generation using Reddit data and article writing using New York Times articles. Experiments show the model outperforms competitive baselines in automatic and human evaluations.In summary, the main contribution seems to be the DYPLOC framework that enables dynamic content planning during generation by leveraging mixed language models and content augmentation. The model demonstrates improved coherence, relevance, and content richness compared to prior approaches on subjective text generation tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new text generation framework called DYPLOC that dynamically plans content during generation using mixed language models conditioned on augmented input consisting of entities, concepts, and claims.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other research on long-form opinion text generation:- The paper focuses on addressing two main challenges in this area - lack of content planning and control, and the need for diverse types of information to cover both subjective and objective content. These are certainly two of the major obstacles in generating high-quality, coherent long-form opinion text.- The proposed framework DYPLOC dynamically plans content during generation using mixed language models. This is a novel approach compared to prior work that either relies solely on attention for implicit planning or completely decouples planning from realization. Integrating planning and generation addresses a known issue with decoupled approaches.- The content augmentation with relevant concepts and claims is also a key contribution. Previous work has looked at incorporating knowledge bases or other external information, but this specifically targets generating the types of content needed for opinion text - both factual and subjective.- The approach is evaluated on two new challenging datasets - argument generation using Reddit ChangeMyView data and opinion article writing using New York Times articles. Many prior efforts in this space have focused on review generation or dialogue systems. Tackling longer argumentative articles across diverse topics is a useful advance.- Compared to state-of-the-art models like BART, the proposed approach shows significantly stronger performance on both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The gains on coherence and content richness demonstrate the benefits of content planning and augmentation.Overall, this paper makes important contributions in addressing known weaknesses of existing methods for long-form opinion generation. The novel framework, content enhancement strategies, and challenging datasets help advance the state-of-the-art in generating higher quality coherent opinion text.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Improving the accuracy and coverage of the concept expansion module. The paper notes that using system-generated concepts leads to a drop in performance compared to using gold standard concepts. They suggest exploring more accurate and comprehensive methods for concept expansion.- Designing better representations to model stances, opinions, and argument structure. The authors note their model is not always able to capture nuanced semantics and opinions. They suggest developing specialized representations tailored for argumentative text generation.- Generalizing the approach to other text generation tasks by using standard NLP pipelines to extract entities and concepts. The authors highlight the general applicability of their framework beyond the two tasks they experimented with.- Removing the need for explicit training signals for the planning module. Currently their model requires annotated alignment between content items and target text. The authors suggest investigating ways to remove this requirement.- Exploring alternative marginalization methods beyond weighted sums over language models. The paper experimented with greedy selection and random selection, but other options could be explored.- Scaling up training with more data and iterations to improve implicit learning of planning through marginalization. The authors believe larger datasets could help learn planning without explicit supervision.In summary, the key directions are improving concept expansion, representation learning for argumentation, generalizing the framework, removing planning supervision, exploring marginalization methods, and scaling up training. The authors lay out a promising research agenda for controllable neural text generation.
