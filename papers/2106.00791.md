# DYPLOC: Dynamic Planning of Content Using Mixed Language Models for Text   Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an effective framework for dynamic content planning and long-form opinion text generation using mixed language models?The key points are:- Existing neural text generation models struggle with coherence and lack efficient content control/planning, especially for long-form opinion articles.- Opinion text generation needs diverse types of information (subjective and objective) to guide the generator to cover relevant content.- The authors propose a new framework called DYPLOC that conducts dynamic planning of content during text generation using mixed language models.- DYPLOC takes as input a set of unordered content items containing entities, concepts, and claims. It expands the concepts using a pre-trained BART model and generates claims using another BART model.- During decoding, DYPLOC selects which content items to reflect at each step based on a learned plan scoring module, and predicts the next word based on probabilities marginalized over the mixed language models.- Experiments on argument generation (with Reddit CMV data) and opinion article writing (with NYT data) show DYPLOC outperforms competitive baselines on both automatic metrics and human evaluation.In summary, the central hypothesis is that integrating dynamic content planning through mixed language models, along with expanding the input concepts and claims, will improve coherence, content coverage, and quality for long-form opinion text generation. The results generally validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the proposal of a novel text generation framework called DYPLOC that can dynamically plan content while generating output text. The key ideas include:- Using mixed language models conditioned on multiple content items to allow flexible content selection and ordering during decoding. This overcomes limitations of previous approaches that rely solely on attention or decouple planning and generation.- Designing content items to cover entities, concepts, and claims to incorporate both objective and subjective information. Additional concepts and claims are generated to enrich the content. - Applying the framework to two challenging opinion text generation tasks - argument generation using Reddit data and article writing using New York Times articles. Experiments show the model outperforms competitive baselines in automatic and human evaluations.In summary, the main contribution seems to be the DYPLOC framework that enables dynamic content planning during generation by leveraging mixed language models and content augmentation. The model demonstrates improved coherence, relevance, and content richness compared to prior approaches on subjective text generation tasks.
