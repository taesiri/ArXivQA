# [Building a Winning Team: Selecting Source Model Ensembles using a   Submodular Transferability Estimation Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02429)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it addresses is: How can we effectively estimate the transferability of an ensemble of pre-trained deep learning models to a new target task, in order to select a well-performing ensemble without having to fine-tune all possible combinations?

The key hypothesis is that considering three factors - domain difference, task difference, and inter-model cohesion - can lead to a better transferability estimate for model ensembles compared to prior approaches.

In summary, the paper proposes a new transferability metric called OSBORN that accounts for these three factors when estimating how well an ensemble of pre-trained models will transfer to a new task. It aims to reliably estimate ensemble performance so that a small well-performing subset can be selected from a large pool of candidate models without exhaustive fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a new transferability estimation metric called OSBORN (Optimal Transport-based Submodular Transferability metric) for selecting source model ensembles for a target task. 

- OSBORN considers three key factors in estimating ensemble transferability - domain difference, task difference, and inter-model cohesion. It uses optimal transport to measure domain difference, conditional entropy for task difference, and a novel cohesion term to capture relationships between models in the ensemble.

- Showing that OSBORN can be posed as a submodular optimization problem, allowing efficient greedy maximization for selecting good model ensembles.

- Evaluating OSBORN extensively on image classification and segmentation tasks using multiple datasets, model architectures, and pre-training methods. It outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods like MS-LEEP and E-LEEP across different correlation measures.

- Conducting additional analysis and ablation studies to demonstrate the contribution of each component of OSBORN and providing insights into transferability estimation for ensembles.

In summary, the key novelty of this work seems to be the proposal of OSBORN, which is the first ensemble transferability estimation metric that holistically accounts for domain difference, task difference and model relationships in a principled manner. The submodularity view also allows efficient optimization. The comprehensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of OSBORN over strong baselines.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new transfer learning method called OSBORN that selects an optimal ensemble of source models for a target task by considering domain difference, task difference, and model cohesiveness between the source models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my understanding, here is a brief comparison of this paper to other related work in transfer learning and transferability estimation:

- This paper focuses specifically on transferability estimation for model ensembles, whereas much prior work has focused only on single source model selection. The most relevant prior work is MS-LEEP and E-LEEP, which also look at ensemble transferability, but this paper argues those methods are limited because they only consider model outputs and not other factors like feature space mismatch.

- Compared to single source transferability papers like LEEP, LogME, and OTCE, this paper incorporates additional considerations like model cohesiveness and poses the problem as a submodular optimization. It also evaluates on a wider range of tasks like segmentation and domain adaptation.

- Most prior transferability estimation papers focus only on fully supervised pre-training. This paper considers both fully supervised and self-supervised pre-training strategies.

- The inclusion of optimal transport for measuring domain mismatch builds on OTCE, but adapts it for the ensemble setting. The cohesiveness term and submodular optimization formulation are novel contributions not considered in prior work.

- The experimental evaluation is quite comprehensive compared to prior work, spanning multiple datasets, tasks, and pre-training schemes. The only other paper that compares on such a breadth is MS-LEEP.

- Overall, this paper pushes transferability estimation forward into the ensemble domain while properly accounting for factors overlooked by prior work like feature space mismatch and model relationships. The submodularity framing and cohesiveness term are unique contributions that yield improved results.

In summary, this paper advances the state-of-the-art in transferability estimation, especially for model ensembles, through several novel considerations and extensive experimentation. It addresses limitations of prior single source methods and ensemble methods by taking a more holistic approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the computational efficiency of the proposed OSBORN metric, as calculating optimal transport distances can be expensive for large datasets. They suggest exploring approximate OT techniques or leveraging GPU acceleration.

- Studying the applicability of OSBORN to other transfer learning tasks beyond image classification and segmentation, such as object detection, depth estimation, etc. The authors propose their method is general, but do not evaluate it on other tasks.

- Learning or optimizing the weighting coefficients for the different terms in OSBORN (domain difference, task difference, model cohesion) in a principled way rather than hand-tuning them. The authors found the optimal weights vary across datasets.

- Incorporating OSBORN into the training process itself to guide model selection during ensemble training, rather than just using it as a post-hoc analysis tool. 

- Exploring whether the submodularity property can be further exploited, for example for incremental greedy ensemble construction.

- Scaling up the analysis to even larger model pools and source datasets. The experiments used around 10-20 source datasets but there are now over 100+ publicly available model zoos and datasets.

- Studying OSBORN's applicability for selecting model architectures themselves, rather than just pre-trained weights. The current work looks at varying weights but fixes architectures.

In summary, the main directions are around computational scaling, expanding OSBORN's applicability to new transfer learning settings and tasks, automating hyperparameter tuning, and leveraging the submodularity for more efficient ensemble construction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel transferability estimation metric called OSBORN for selecting an optimal ensemble of source models for a given target task. OSBORN considers three factors - domain difference, task difference, and inter-model cohesion - to reliably estimate the transferability of an ensemble of pre-trained models to a downstream task. It measures the mismatch between source and target domains using optimal transport, the mismatch between source and target tasks using conditional entropy, and the agreement amongst models using conditional entropy. The metric is designed as a submodular function, allowing a greedy optimization strategy for efficient ensemble selection. Experiments are conducted on image classification and segmentation using a diverse set of datasets, architectures, and pre-training methods. Results demonstrate that OSBORN outperforms existing metrics like MS-LEEP and E-LEEP by large margins across tasks and evaluation criteria. The key novelty is a cohesion-aware ensemble transferability estimation metric with strong empirical performance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel transferability estimation metric called OSBORN for selecting source model ensembles for a given target task. Transferability estimation is important to select optimal pre-trained models for a target task without expensive fine-tuning of all available source models. While prior works have focused on transferability estimation for single source models, this paper tackles the problem of estimating transferability for ensembles. 

The key idea in OSBORN is to consider three factors - domain difference, task difference and inter-model cohesion while estimating transferability of an ensemble. It captures domain difference via optimal transport between source and target latent features, task difference via conditional entropy between predicted and ground truth labels, and cohesion via mutual information between ensemble model predictions. The proposed metric is shown to be submodular, allowing a simple greedy optimization strategy for ensemble selection. Extensive experiments are conducted on image classification and segmentation showing OSBORN's superior performance over existing methods on correlation metrics. The technique is promising for transfer learning practitioners to efficiently select optimal source model ensembles.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel optimal transport-based transferability estimation metric called OSBORN for selecting source model ensembles. OSBORN considers three factors - domain difference, task difference, and inter-model cohesion. It measures the latent space mismatch between source and target datasets using optimal transport to compute the domain difference. The task difference is measured as the mismatch between classifier outputs for source and target data. To account for interactions between models in the ensemble, a novel model cohesion term based on conditional entropy is proposed. By combining these three quantities, OSBORN provides a transferability estimate for a source model ensemble on a given target dataset. The metric is designed as a submodular function, allowing greedy maximization to efficiently rank and select models from a pool. Extensive experiments show OSBORN reliably estimates ensemble transferability, outperforming existing methods on tasks like classification and segmentation.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing the problem of selecting good source model ensembles for transfer learning. Specifically, it seems to focus on developing a method to estimate how transferable an ensemble of source models will be to a new target task/dataset.

The key questions it seems to tackle are:

- How can we quantify the transferability of an ensemble of models instead of just a single model?

- How can we select good complementary source models to form an ensemble that will transfer well to a target task? 

- How can we do this selection efficiently from a large pool of candidate source models?

The paper proposes a new transferability metric called OSBORN that considers three factors:

1) Domain difference - how different the source and target datasets are based on their latent representations

2) Task difference - how different the source and target tasks are based on output predictions 

3) Model cohesion - how much agreement/correlation there is between models in the candidate ensemble

It shows how this metric can be optimized in a submodular way to efficiently search for good model ensembles from a source pool. The proposed approach is evaluated on image classification and segmentation tasks.

In summary, the key focus seems to be on efficiently estimating ensemble transferability in a way that accounts for model relationships, instead of just individual model strengths. This allows better complementary models to be selected from a source pool.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and main ideas are:

- Transfer learning - The paper focuses on transfer learning, which involves taking knowledge gained from training a model on one task and applying it to a related new task. The goal is to improve learning on the new task by transferring knowledge from the original model.

- Transferability estimation - The paper specifically looks at estimating the transferability of models, which refers to how well a pretrained model will perform when transferred to a new target task or dataset. The goal is to estimate this without having to do expensive fine-tuning. 

- Source and target datasets - In transfer learning, there are source datasets/tasks where models are originally trained, and target datasets/tasks where the pretrained models are transferred to. Estimating transferability aims to select good source models for a given target.

- Optimal transport - The proposed metric uses optimal transport to measure the distribution mismatch between source and target datasets in a domain-agnostic way. 

- Model cohesion - The paper proposes a new model cohesion term to measure the agreement between models in an ensemble, to select models that positively reinforce each other.

- Submodularity - The proposed transferability metric is designed as a submodular function, which allows greedily selecting a good ensemble of source models.

- Experiments on classification, segmentation, domain adaptation - The method is evaluated extensively on different computer vision tasks to demonstrate its applicability.

In summary, the key focus is on reliably estimating the transferability of model ensembles for a target task in a way that considers multiple important factors like domain gap, task gap, and model coherence.
