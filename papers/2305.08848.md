# [Small Models are Valuable Plug-ins for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08848)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we effectively combine large language models (LLMs) with smaller fine-tuned models to improve performance on supervised NLP tasks?

Specifically, the paper proposes a new method called "Super In-Context Learning" (SuperICL) that allows large black-box language models like GPT-3 to work together with smaller locally fine-tuned models like RoBERTa. The key hypothesis is that by incorporating predictions and confidence scores from the smaller "plug-in" models into the context for the LLM, the overall model can achieve better performance compared to just using the LLM alone with in-context learning. 

The paper aims to demonstrate that SuperICL can:

- Achieve superior performance compared to just using the LLM or smaller model alone
- Address instability issues with standard in-context learning
- Enhance capabilities of smaller models, like extending multilinguality
- Provide interpretability by having the LLM generate explanations

In summary, the central research question is how to effectively combine large black-box LLMs with smaller plug-in models trained on task-specific data to get performance gains on supervised NLP tasks. The proposed SuperICL method aims to test the hypothesis that this combination can outperform either model individually.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Super In-Context Learning (SuperICL), a method that combines large language models (LLMs) with locally fine-tuned smaller models to improve performance on supervised NLP tasks. The key ideas are:

- Using a smaller pre-trained model as a "plug-in" that is fine-tuned on the full training set of a task, since smaller models are more accessible for fine-tuning. 

- Constructing a context for the LLM that includes labeled examples from the training set along with the plug-in model's predictions and confidences. This allows the LLM to learn from the plug-in's expertise.

- During inference, the LLM takes the test input, plug-in prediction, and makes the final prediction, optionally providing an explanation when overriding the plug-in's prediction.

- Experiments show SuperICL outperforms LLM in-context learning and fine-tuned smaller models on GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. It also demonstrates improved stability and interpretability compared to standard in-context learning.

In summary, the main contribution is using fine-tuned smaller models as plug-ins to improve large model performance on supervised NLP tasks, overcoming limitations like model size and limited accessibility that hinders directly fine-tuning large models. The combination provides strengths of both small and large models.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- The key idea of combining large and small models is novel compared to prior work on in-context learning. Most prior work focuses on selecting or optimizing the examples for the context, whereas this paper introduces the idea of using a separately fine-tuned small model as a "plug-in". 

- The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art results by combining large and small models, outperforming both in-context learning and fine-tuned models alone. This shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- The idea of incorporating confidence scores from the small model is unique. This provides helpful uncertainty information to guide the large model's predictions. Prior work does not consider confidence in this way.

- The paper provides useful analysis into the model's prediction override behavior based on confidence scores. This sheds light on the internal mechanics of how the large model utilizes the small model's knowledge.

- The stability analysis demonstrates an advantage over standard in-context learning, which is known to be unstable based on example selection. Leveraging a separately trained small model helps absorb task-specific knowledge.

- Exploring the effect of adversarial attacks on the small model is insightful. It reveals a potential limitation of relying on the small model, if it is not robust.

Overall, I would say the core idea of SuperICL and the analyses around confidence scores, stability, and adversarial attacks help advance the field's understanding of combining large pretrained models with smaller task-specific models. The state-of-the-art results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach as a practical technique. The paper makes several novel contributions compared to prior work on in-context learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Explore using large language models to plan for the fine-tuning of the local plug-in model for an unseen task and automate the entire workflow. This could allow SuperICL to be more adaptable to new tasks.

- Conduct theoretical analysis to further reveal the internal mechanism of SuperICL. This could provide better understanding of why and how SuperICL works. 

- Evaluate SuperICL on a broader range of tasks beyond text classification, such as text summarization, question answering, and semantic parsing. This could demonstrate the general applicability of SuperICL.

- Investigate whether SuperICL has any effect on amplifying or decreasing social biases present in language models. This could reveal the broader societal impacts of the approach. 

- Consider the trade-offs between performance gains from SuperICL and increased carbon footprint from incorporating both small and large models. This could inform responsible and ethical usage of the technique.

- Experiment with more advanced large language models beyond GPT-3.5 to fully realize the potential improvements of SuperICL.

- Develop adaptations of SuperICL that are more robust to adversarial attacks on the plug-in models. This could address the vulnerability limitation.

In summary, the authors suggest enhancements to SuperICL's adaptability, explainability, applicability, fairness, environmental impact, and robustness as important directions for future work. Advancing research in these areas could lead to further improvements in combining large and small language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Super In-Context Learning (SuperICL), a method that combines large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 with smaller fine-tuned models to improve performance on supervised NLP tasks. SuperICL uses the smaller model as a "plug-in" that provides task-specific predictions and confidence scores for each input. These are incorporated into the context for the LLM, which then makes the final prediction. This allows the LLM to leverage the task knowledge from the fine-tuned smaller model while still relying on its own general language understanding abilities. Experiments on GLUE and XNLI show SuperICL outperforms both in-context learning with just the LLM and the smaller model alone. Analyses reveal SuperICL addresses instability issues with regular in-context learning, provides interpretability through generated explanations, and enhances capabilities like multilinguality. Limitations include additional cost, reliance on plug-in model, and limited tasks evaluated. Overall, SuperICL demonstrates effectively combining large cloud LLMs with small local models for supervised learning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Super In-Context Learning (SuperICL) which combines large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 with smaller fine-tuned models to improve performance on supervised NLP tasks. 

SuperICL works by first fine-tuning a small model like RoBERTa on the training data for a task. This model serves as a "plug-in" that provides predictions and confidence scores on examples from the training set. These predictions are concatenated as context along with the training examples to the LLM. For a test input, the plug-in model's prediction is also given to the LLM, which then predicts the final label and can optionally generate an explanation if it overrides the plug-in model's prediction. Experiments on GLUE and XNLI benchmarks show SuperICL outperforms both the LLM using in-context learning alone and the fine-tuned small model. The paper analyzes different components of SuperICL and shows it addresses instability issues in regular in-context learning. It also demonstrates added benefits like multilinguality and interpretability from the LLM. Overall, SuperICL provides an effective way to combine large black-box LLMs with locally fine-tuned smaller models for supervised NLP tasks.
