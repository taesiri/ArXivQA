# [Audio-Visual Glance Network for Efficient Video Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09322)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central hypothesis of this paper is that using both audio and visual modalities can lead to more efficient and accurate video recognition compared to using only visual information. Specifically, the paper proposes an Audio-Visual Glance Network (AVGN) that aims to improve efficiency in both the temporal and spatial dimensions for video recognition. For temporal efficiency, the paper hypothesizes that accurate recognition can be achieved by processing only a small number of salient frames containing distinctive cues, identified using lightweight audio and visual encoders. For spatial efficiency, the paper hypothesizes that focusing only on important spatial patches rather than full frames is sufficient, where these patches are identified using audio-enhanced visual features.The overarching hypothesis is that by selectively processing only the most salient spatio-temporal parts of a video using both modalities, the AVGN model can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with improved efficiency compared to visual-only approaches. The experiments aim to validate whether audio-visual glancing in both dimensions leads to pareto-optimal solutions in accuracy and efficiency trade-offs.In summary, the central hypothesis is that exploiting audio and visual cues to focus only on the most important spatio-temporal locations allows for more efficient yet accurate video recognition compared to visual-only approaches. The AVGN model and experiments are designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes Audio-Visual Glance Network (AVGN), a new framework for efficient video recognition that processes only the most salient parts of a video based on audio and visual information. 2. AVGN achieves temporal efficiency by using an Audio-Visual Temporal Saliency Transformer (AV-TeST) to estimate frame importance and only process the most salient frames.3. It achieves spatial efficiency by using an Audio-Enhanced Spatial Patch Attention (AESPA) module to identify important spatial patches in each frame and process only those patches.4. The paper shows that incorporating audio can lead to improved accuracy without sacrificing efficiency, achieving a pareto optimal solution.5. AVGN sets new state-of-the-art performance on multiple video recognition benchmarks as a result of its model components and training techniques. 6. Ablation studies demonstrate that the audio modality, AV-TeST, AESPA, and specialized training losses all contribute positively to the model's overall performance.In summary, the key contribution is a new multimodal network architecture and training approach that achieves top accuracy while remaining computationally efficient by selectively processing only the most salient spatio-temporal parts of videos. The incorporation of audio is shown to be beneficial for this goal.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in efficient video recognition:- This paper proposes a new model called Audio-Visual Glance Network (AVGN) for efficient video recognition. It builds on prior work on incorporating audio, adaptively selecting frames, and extracting spatial patches, but combines these strategies in a unified framework. - A key novelty is the use of audio to guide both temporal glance (via the AV-TeST module) and spatial glance (via the AESPA module). This allows AVGN to focus only on the most important parts of a video in both dimensions. Prior work like ListenToLook used audio mainly for temporal sampling.- For temporal efficiency, AVGN is similar to other adaptive frame selection methods like AdaFrame, DSN, and FrameExit. However, AVGN uses a multimodal transformer rather than RNN/LSTM to assess frame importance. The advantage is the ability to jointly model audio and visual data.- For spatial efficiency, the idea of extracting important patches is analogous to AdaFocus. But AVGN incorporates audio guidance through the AESPA module to determine the important patches.- In experiments, AVGN achieves state-of-the-art efficiency vs accuracy trade-offs on ActivityNet and Mini-Kinetics. It outperforms ListenToLook and is competitive with AdaFocus variants while using fewer FLOPs.- Ablation studies demonstrate the synergistic effects of the different components of AVGN, especially the AESPA module. The audio modality provides complementary signals that boost efficiency in both temporal and spatial dimensions.Overall, AVGN advances efficient video recognition by unifying and improving upon prior ideas like adaptive sampling, patch extraction, and audio guidance within a single model. The core novelty is the use of audio to enhance efficiency in both the temporal and spatial domains.
