# [Audio-Visual Glance Network for Efficient Video Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09322)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central hypothesis of this paper is that using both audio and visual modalities can lead to more efficient and accurate video recognition compared to using only visual information. Specifically, the paper proposes an Audio-Visual Glance Network (AVGN) that aims to improve efficiency in both the temporal and spatial dimensions for video recognition. For temporal efficiency, the paper hypothesizes that accurate recognition can be achieved by processing only a small number of salient frames containing distinctive cues, identified using lightweight audio and visual encoders. For spatial efficiency, the paper hypothesizes that focusing only on important spatial patches rather than full frames is sufficient, where these patches are identified using audio-enhanced visual features.The overarching hypothesis is that by selectively processing only the most salient spatio-temporal parts of a video using both modalities, the AVGN model can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with improved efficiency compared to visual-only approaches. The experiments aim to validate whether audio-visual glancing in both dimensions leads to pareto-optimal solutions in accuracy and efficiency trade-offs.In summary, the central hypothesis is that exploiting audio and visual cues to focus only on the most important spatio-temporal locations allows for more efficient yet accurate video recognition compared to visual-only approaches. The AVGN model and experiments are designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes Audio-Visual Glance Network (AVGN), a new framework for efficient video recognition that processes only the most salient parts of a video based on audio and visual information. 2. AVGN achieves temporal efficiency by using an Audio-Visual Temporal Saliency Transformer (AV-TeST) to estimate frame importance and only process the most salient frames.3. It achieves spatial efficiency by using an Audio-Enhanced Spatial Patch Attention (AESPA) module to identify important spatial patches in each frame and process only those patches.4. The paper shows that incorporating audio can lead to improved accuracy without sacrificing efficiency, achieving a pareto optimal solution.5. AVGN sets new state-of-the-art performance on multiple video recognition benchmarks as a result of its model components and training techniques. 6. Ablation studies demonstrate that the audio modality, AV-TeST, AESPA, and specialized training losses all contribute positively to the model's overall performance.In summary, the key contribution is a new multimodal network architecture and training approach that achieves top accuracy while remaining computationally efficient by selectively processing only the most salient spatio-temporal parts of videos. The incorporation of audio is shown to be beneficial for this goal.
