# [A Kaczmarz-inspired approach to accelerate the optimization of neural   network wavefunctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10190)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Optimizing neural network wavefunctions for electronic structure calculations using variational Monte Carlo (VMC) is very challenging due to the large number of parameters and highly nonlinear nature of neural networks.
- Traditional VMC optimizers like stochastic reconfiguration (SR) have cubic scaling with number of parameters so are infeasible for neural network wavefunctions with hundreds of thousands of parameters. 
- Popular machine learning optimizers like KFAC have low per-iteration cost but require very many iterations to converge fully.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new optimizer called Subsampled Projected-Increment Natural Gradient Descent (SPRING) that improves on minimum-step stochastic reconfiguration (MinSR).
- MinSR formulates the SR update as an overdetermined linear least squares problem and solves an underdetermined subproblem based on a minibatch of samples. SPRING projects the previous MinSR update onto the solution space of the current minibatch subproblem, inspired by the randomized block Kaczmarz method.
- This allows SPRING to incorporate optimization history to better approximate the true SR update at almost no extra cost compared to MinSR.

Main Contributions:
- The SPRING optimizer combines ideas from MinSR and the randomized block Kaczmarz method in a novel way tailored to optimizing neural network wavefunctions.
- Experiments on small atoms and molecules show SPRING consistently outperforms MinSR, momentum-enhanced MinSR, and KFAC given optimal tuning of learning rates.
- For example, on oxygen atom, SPRING reaches chemical accuracy 4x faster than MinSR/KFAC and continues improving unlike the other methods.
- Provides promising new direction to alleviate key bottleneck in applying neural network wavefunctions to larger chemical systems.

In summary, the authors make important progress towards more scalable optimization of neural network wavefunctions by blending complementary ideas from physics and machine learning. The proposed SPRING optimizer elegantly adapts the randomized block Kaczmarz method to significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches on small systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new optimizer called Subsampled Projected-Increment Natural Gradient Descent (SPRING) to accelerate the optimization of neural network wavefunctions in quantum chemistry calculations, combining ideas from minimum-step stochastic reconfiguration and the randomized Kaczmarz method for solving linear least-squares problems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is a new optimizer called Subsampled Projected-Increment Natural Gradient Descent (SPRING) for optimizing neural network wavefunctions in quantum chemistry calculations. Specifically:

- SPRING combines ideas from the recently proposed MinSR optimizer and the randomized Kaczmarz method for solving overdetermined linear least squares problems. 

- By doing so, SPRING is able to utilize optimization history to improve upon MinSR in a principled way at essentially no extra computational cost.

- The authors test SPRING on several small atoms and molecules and find that it consistently outperforms alternatives like MinSR, MinSR with momentum, and KFAC across all tested systems when the learning rates are properly tuned.

So in summary, the main contribution is the proposal and empirical validation of the SPRING optimizer for accelerating the optimization of neural network wavefunctions in quantum chemistry.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the SPRING method proposed in the paper:

1) How exactly does the SPRING update formula arise from taking one step of the randomized block Kaczmarz method, applied to the previous parameter update? What assumptions need to hold for this interpretation to be valid?

2) The paper mentions that several discrepancies prevent direct transfer of convergence results from the Kaczmarz method to the VMC setting with SPRING. What are these key discrepancies and how might the SPRING algorithm be modified to enable convergence guarantees?

3) How does the inclusion of the decay parameter μ in the SPRING update formula distinguish it from the standard Kaczmarz method? What purpose does this decay serve and how was the default value of μ=0.99 chosen?

4) The paper draws a connection between SPRING and momentum methods. In what sense can SPRING be viewed as a momentum method with an added projection step? How does this perspective differ from the Kaczmarz interpretation?

5) Why does directly using the SPRING update formula without the μ parameter lead to unstable optimization? What causes the instability and how does introducing μ resolve it?

6) How exactly does the inclusion of the matrix P in the SPRING update formula improve numerical stability? What causes the matrix T to become near-singular and how does adding P avoid issues with inversion?

7) What are the computational complexity and bottleneck operations for SPRING compared to MinSR? Under what conditions will SPRING be slower or faster than KFAC?

8) The paper speculates that sampling configurations proportional to the square of the gradient norm could improve SPRING. How would this sampling strategy connect to existing Kaczmarz convergence results and what difficulties need to be overcome to implement it?

9) How does the connection to efficient subsampled natural gradient descent place SPRING in the broader context of optimization methods for deep learning? What potential value does SPRING offer in application areas beyond VMC?

10) What open questions remain about the convergence properties of SPRING under the constraints of the VMC setting? What modifications to the algorithm could make convergence analysis more tractable?
