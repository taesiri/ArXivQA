# [Data-Efficient Image Recognition with Contrastive Predictive Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09272)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be that representations which make natural signal variability more predictable enable more data-efficient image recognition. In particular, the authors hypothesize that:- Unsupervised representations that increase the spatial predictability of images will allow artificial vision systems to achieve more human-like data efficiency on recognition tasks.- Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) is a suitable objective for learning such spatially predictable representations. To test these hypotheses, the main experiments in the paper evaluate whether CPC representations enable neural networks to accurately classify images and detect objects using substantially fewer labeled examples than when training on raw pixels.The key findings are:- Classifiers trained on CPC representations achieve much higher accuracy with limited labeled data compared to classifiers trained on pixels, allowing them to match the performance of supervised networks trained with 2-5x more labels.- The CPC representation even surpasses fully supervised networks when classifying all of ImageNet, despite using no labels to train the representation.- Transferring the CPC representation to object detection on PASCAL VOC also exceeds the performance of supervised pre-training, confirming the generality of the representation.In summary, the central hypothesis of the paper is that spatially predictable representations obtained through CPC enable more data-efficient image recognition, which is supported by the experimental results. Evaluating the CPC representation in low-data regimes is the primary way this hypothesis is tested.
