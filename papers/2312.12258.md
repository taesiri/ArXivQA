# [Inferring the relationship between soil temperature and the normalized   difference vegetation index with machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12258)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement: 
This paper investigates the relationship between soil temperature and vegetation phenology in subarctic grasslands, as measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Specifically, the authors examine how soil temperature affects three vegetation phenology characteristics: the start of the growing season (SOS), the peak or maximum annual NDVI (PEAK), and the peak date of the season (POS). They also explore the impact of other meteorological variables like air temperature, precipitation and irradiance on inter-annual variation in these characteristics.

Proposed Solution:
The authors utilize six years (2014-2019) of NDVI data collected from 50 plots across natural soil temperature gradients, along with corresponding soil temperature data. They fit double logistic curves to estimate SOS, POS and PEAK NDVI values for each plot and year. Linear models are first used to assess the average response, then multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) using meteorological variables are trained to predict these characteristics. SHAP values explain the importance of variables.

Main Contributions:

- Show soil warming shifts SOS 1.5 days earlier per °C and POS 1.7 days earlier per °C 

- PEAK NDVI increases slightly with higher soil temperatures

- Meteorological variables explain a larger part of inter-annual variation than soil temperature

- Using ML and SHAP values enhances understanding of relationships between variables  

- Proof of concept for using advanced ML techniques in ecological studies

The work provides valuable insights into factors driving subarctic grassland dynamics and foundations for future phenology research.
