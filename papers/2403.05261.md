# [Cross-Modal and Uni-Modal Soft-Label Alignment for Image-Text Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05261)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper identifies two key problems with current image-text retrieval (ITR) models:

1) Inter-modal matching missing problem: Due to contrastive learning and random sampling during training, some image-text pairs that should match are incorrectly treated as negatives, hurting model performance. 

2) Intra-modal semantic loss problem: Most ITR models focus only on aligning images and texts across modalities, but disregard relationships within each modality. This limits the model's ability to recognize similar inputs.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Cross-modal and Uni-modal Soft-label Alignment (CUSA) method to address these issues. The key ideas are:

1) Use uni-modal pre-trained models (e.g. Unicom for images, SentenceBERT for text) to generate soft-labels that capture fine-grained semantic similarities between samples.

2) Perform Cross-modal Soft-label Alignment (CSA) to use the soft-labels to overcome false negatives during training. This helps align potential matches across modalities. 

3) Perform Uni-modal Soft-label Alignment (USA) to use soft-labels to enhance similarity recognition within each modality. This improves generalization.

4) CUSA is plug-and-play and can be applied to existing ITR models without architecture changes.

Main Contributions:

- Identify inter-modal and intra-modal limitations of current ITR methods 

- Propose CSA and USA techniques to leverage soft-labels for better cross-modal and uni-modal alignment

- Achieve new SOTA results on MSCOCO, Flickr30K and ECCV Caption datasets across various ITR models

- Show improved uni-modal retrieval, enabling universal retrieval abilities

- Provide simple plug-and-play approach that is widely compatible with existing models

In summary, the paper offers an effective way to overcome false negatives and enhance similarity recognition in ITR via soft-label guided alignment, leading to performance improvements. The plug-and-play nature also makes adoption easy.
