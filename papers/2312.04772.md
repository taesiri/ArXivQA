# [Remembering to Be Fair: On Non-Markovian Fairness in Sequential   DecisionMaking (Preliminary Report)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04772)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces the notion of non-Markovian fairness for sequential decision making, where fairness depends on the history of decisions made over time, not just the current state. They define non-Markovian fair decision processes (NMFDPs) where the fairness function considers the entire trace of states and actions. They discuss different realizations of fairness functions, like Nash welfare, Rawlsian social welfare, and novel metrics like "time in first place." Different notions of fair policies are also proposed, including fair in the limit, anytime fair, periodically fair, and fair-optimal. A key insight is the role of memory in converting non-Markovian fairness functions into Markovian ones. With sufficient memory, an NMFDP can be transformed into an equivalent Markovian process, enabling standard reinforcement learning methods to find fair policies. Overall, the paper lays theoretical foundations to study history-dependent fairness in sequential settings with multiple stakeholders. Formalizing non-Markovian fairness exposes new dimensions for fair sequential decision making.
