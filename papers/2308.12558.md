# [Hyperbolic Audio-visual Zero-shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12558)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis seems to be:Whether incorporating hyperbolic geometry and alignment of audio and visual features in that geometry can improve audio-visual zero-shot learning by better capturing the hierarchical structure in the data. The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Audio-visual data exhibits hierarchical structure that could be beneficial to leverage for the task. 2) Hyperbolic geometry is well-suited for representing hierarchical structure.3) Aligning audio and visual features in hyperbolic geometry can enable the model to learn more informative representations that reflect the hierarchy. 4) This approach can improve performance on audio-visual zero-shot learning compared to prior work that does not consider hierarchy or operate in hyperbolic space.The paper proposes and evaluates different modules (Hyper-alignment, Hyper-single, Hyper-multiple) for incorporating hyperbolic alignment between audio and visual features. Experiments on three datasets aim to validate whether this proposed hyperbolic audio-visual learning approach can improve over the prior state-of-the-art on the audio-visual zero-shot learning task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces a novel hyperbolic alignment module to improve cross-modality representations in audio-visual zero-shot learning. The key contributions are:- Proposing to leverage hyperbolic geometry to align audio and visual features before fusion. This allows capturing the hierarchical structure in the data to learn more distinctive embeddings. - Introducing three module designs: Hyper-alignment, Hyper-single, and Hyper-multiple to incorporate hyperbolic alignment losses. Hyper-alignment uses a fixed curvature, while Hyper-single and Hyper-multiple adapt the curvature. - Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed hyperbolic alignment modules through experiments on three datasets - VGGSound-GZSL, UCF-GZSL and ActivityNet-GZSL. The results show performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.- Providing analysis such as t-SNE visualizations and Î´-hyperbolicity metric to demonstrate that the hyperbolic alignment enables learning features with stronger hierarchical properties.In summary, the key contribution is using curvature-aware hyperbolic geometry to align audio-visual features for improved representation learning in audio-visual zero-shot classification. This provides a new perspective of leveraging hierarchical structures in the data through geometric learning.
