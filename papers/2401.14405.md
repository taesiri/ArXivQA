# [Multimodal Pathway: Improve Transformers with Irrelevant Data from Other   Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14405)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods utilize multimodal learning with paired or interleaved data samples from different modalities (e.g. image-text). However, it is an open problem whether transformers can be improved on a target modality using completely irrelevant data from another modality. For example, it seems unlikely that a pure audio dataset could help improve image classification performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Multimodal Pathway Transformers (M2PT), a framework to improve performance on a target modality using irrelevant data from another auxiliary modality. 
- The key idea is to utilize two separate transformers trained on unimodal datasets from the target and auxiliary modalities.
- "Pathways" are constructed to connect components between the two transformers to allow the auxiliary model's knowledge to facilitate processing in the target model.
- A concrete and efficient implementation named Cross-Modal Re-parameterization is used, which adds connections between corresponding linear layers in the two models with marginal training costs and no inference costs.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the novel concept of using irrelevant multimodal data to improve transformers via the Multimodal Pathway framework and Cross-Modal Re-parameterization method.
- Achieves significant and consistent performance gains across experiments on image, video, point cloud and audio datasets by exploiting irrelevant data from alternate modalities. 
- Reveals the existence of transferable "modality-complementary knowledge" in transformers related to universal sequence-to-sequence modelling abilities and hierarchical representation learning.
- Represents an early but promising exploration in this direction which offers a new perspective for multimodal learning.

In summary, the key innovation is improving transformers by connecting them to entirely unrelated data from other modalities, which contrasts with existing multimodal methods relying on aligned data pairs/tuples. This is shown empirically to work across diverse modalities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Multimodal Pathway Transformer (M2PT), a method that improves transformers on a target modality by establishing pathways to exploit irrelevant data from an auxiliary modality, and shows consistent performance gains across image, video, point cloud, and audio recognition tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes Multimodal Pathway, which is a framework to improve transformers via exploiting models trained on other modalities, even when the data samples from different modalities are irrelevant (unpaired).

2. It proposes an inference-cost-free implementation of Multimodal Pathway called Cross-Modal Re-parameterization. 

3. It demonstrates consistent and significant improvements brought by Multimodal Pathway on image, video, point cloud, and audio recognition tasks. This shows the potential of the method as a promising approach to utilize irrelevant data from other modalities.

4. It represents an early exploration towards improving performance on one modality using irrelevant data from other modalities. This offers a novel perspective distinct from prior works relying on paired or aligned multimodal data.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of the Multimodal Pathway framework and its effective Cross-Modal Re-parameterization implementation to improve transformers by exploiting irrelevant data from other modalities. The consistent gains validate it as a promising approach.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Multimodal Pathway 
- Cross-Modal Re-parameterization
- Transformers
- Pathways between models of different modalities (image, video, point cloud, audio)
- Exploiting models trained on irrelevant data from other modalities 
- Modality-complementary knowledge in transformers
- Universal sequence-to-sequence modeling abilities of transformers
- Consistent performance improvements across modalities by utilizing irrelevant data

The main ideas explored in the paper are using transformers trained on one modality (e.g. image) to improve performance of transformers on another modality (e.g. point cloud) by creating pathways between components of the two models, even though the training data is irrelevant between the modalities. This is enabled by the universal modeling abilities of transformers and some modality-complementary knowledge they acquire. The proposed methods realize consistent performance gains across multiple modalities.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes establishing "pathways" between components of models trained on different modalities. What are some potential ways to determine the optimal connections between components to maximize transferability of knowledge?

2. The paper utilizes models pretrained on different datasets as proxies for modalities. How can we ensure the pretrained models sufficiently encapsulate the key characteristics of each modality?

3. The paper argues the improvements are not solely due to more parameters or better initialization. What further analyses could be done to strengthen this argument? For example, deliberately using poor initializations.  

4. The paper suggests the transferred knowledge may be related to processing hierarchical representations. What experiments could isolate and test this hypothesis? For example, manipulating the depth of the pathways.

5. The method improves performance even when fixing weights of linear layers in transformer blocks. Does this suggest the improvements are more related to representation learning rather than model fitting?

6. How sensitive are the improvements to the choice of auxiliary modality? Is there an optimal modality pairing for each target modality?

7. Can analysis of the learnt cross-modal scale parameters provide insight into which components benefit most from multimodal pathways?

8. The method merges parameters after training. Could the pathways be kept to enable dynamic adjustment at test time?

9. What metrics could be used to quantify the degree of "irrelevance" between modalities? Does higher irrelevance lead to greater improvements?  

10. The paper focuses on vision and audio modalities. How well would the approach transfer to modalities with more distinct input types such as text or tabular data?
