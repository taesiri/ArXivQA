# [Cheap Ways of Extracting Clinical Markers from Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11227)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Identifying evidence of suicidal risk level in Reddit posts is important for providing support and taking preventive measures. However, relying solely on algorithms can introduce biases and risks. 
- Large language models (LLMs) are state-of-the-art in NLP but can be expensive and unavailable for many languages.

Proposed Solutions: 
1) Good old-fashioned machine learning (GOML) pipeline 
- Uses tf-idf features and logistic regression classifier to identify important sentences
- Computes feature importance scores to select highlight spans
- Generates extractive summaries using TextRank on important sentences 

2) Language models 
- Uses 4-bit quantized OpenHermes model for efficiency
- Employs chain-of-thought prompting to extract highlight sequences  
- Generates abstractive summaries by concatenating important sentences and prompting model

Key Contributions:
- Evaluates GOML pipeline against LLM approach for identifying suicidal evidence
- GOML pipeline is very fast and memory-efficient, achieves high highlight recall score  
- Combining GOML for highlights and LLM for summaries gives best performance
- Provides analysis showing important sentences have distinct linguistic patterns
- Demonstrates competitive performance without large models or resources
- Discusses issues with evaluation metrics and human judgment requirements

In summary, the paper explores computationally cheaper alternatives to large models for extracting suicidal evidence, with a GOML pipeline demonstrating strong highlight detection and a combination with LLM generation providing top performance.
