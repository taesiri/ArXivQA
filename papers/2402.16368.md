# [SPINEPS -- Automatic Whole Spine Segmentation of T2-weighted MR images   using a Two-Phase Approach to Multi-class Semantic and Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16368)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Currently no automatic approach exists for MRI whole spine segmentation, including posterior vertebral elements like spinous processes. 
- Most existing methods are limited to the lumbar region or only segment a few spinal structures (e.g. vertebral body). 
- Manual segmentation of large datasets is laborious.  

Proposed Solution:
- Present a two-phase deep learning approach called SPINEPS for semantic and instance segmentation of 14 spine structures in whole body T2-weighted MRI. 
- Structures include 10 vertebra substructures, intervertebral discs, spinal cord, spinal canal, and sacrum.
- First phase is a semantic segmentation model based on nnU-Net architecture.
- Second phase uses a sliding window approach on the semantic output to distinguish instances, especially challenging for vertebrae.
- Models are trained on combined automated annotations from multiple sources, including translated CT segmentations.

Main Contributions:
- Publicly available algorithm for whole spine segmentation in T2-weighted MRI, marking the first of its kind. Enables analysis for large-scale spine studies.
- Two-phase approach achieves improved semantic and instance segmentation performance over baseline, with robustness to outliers.
- Method to generate labels for MRI through combining multiple automatic annotation procedures, saving extensive manual effort.
- Evaluation on public SPIDER dataset and German National Cohort subset demonstrates accuracy and generalizability of technique.
- Qualitative assessment on diverse in-house data further supports applicability to varied datasets.
