# [Temporal Interpolation Is All You Need for Dynamic Neural Radiance   Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09311)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to extend neural radiance fields (NeRF) to model dynamic scenes. The key hypothesis is that using temporal interpolation of feature vectors can be an effective approach for training dynamic NeRFs.Specifically, the paper proposes:- A neural representation that uses temporal interpolation of features extracted by MLPs from space-time inputs. This aims to capture both short-term and long-term dynamic features.- A grid representation that extends recent hash grid methods to 4D and uses quadrilinear interpolation of features in space-time. This aims to achieve very fast training for dynamic scenes. The overarching goal is to show that simple temporal interpolation of features can work surprisingly well for dynamic NeRFs, without needing complex deformation or flow estimation modules like prior work. The paper validates this through extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets using both the neural and grid representations.In summary, the core hypothesis is that temporal feature interpolation is sufficient for training high-quality dynamic NeRFs in a simple and efficient manner. The experiments aim to substantiate this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing a novel method to train dynamic neural radiance fields (NeRFs) of dynamic scenes based on temporal interpolation of feature vectors. - Introducing two feature interpolation methods depending on the underlying representation - neural networks or grids.- For the neural representation, a multi-level feature interpolation network is proposed that effectively captures both short-term and long-term dynamic features. This achieves high quality rendering with small model size.- For the grid representation, extending recent instant neural graphics primitives (Instant-NGP) to 4D space-time grids. This enables training dynamic NeRFs in just a few minutes.- Proposing a smoothness regularizer on the feature space that further improves performance for both representations. - Achieving state-of-the-art results on various datasets with both the neural and grid representations. The neural representation produces high quality view synthesis while the grid representation enables extremely fast training.In summary, the main contribution is proposing temporal interpolation of features as an effective approach to train dynamic NeRFs. This simple yet powerful idea is shown to work well with both neural network and grid based representations.
