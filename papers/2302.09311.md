# [Temporal Interpolation Is All You Need for Dynamic Neural Radiance   Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09311)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to extend neural radiance fields (NeRF) to model dynamic scenes. The key hypothesis is that using temporal interpolation of feature vectors can be an effective approach for training dynamic NeRFs.Specifically, the paper proposes:- A neural representation that uses temporal interpolation of features extracted by MLPs from space-time inputs. This aims to capture both short-term and long-term dynamic features.- A grid representation that extends recent hash grid methods to 4D and uses quadrilinear interpolation of features in space-time. This aims to achieve very fast training for dynamic scenes. The overarching goal is to show that simple temporal interpolation of features can work surprisingly well for dynamic NeRFs, without needing complex deformation or flow estimation modules like prior work. The paper validates this through extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets using both the neural and grid representations.In summary, the core hypothesis is that temporal feature interpolation is sufficient for training high-quality dynamic NeRFs in a simple and efficient manner. The experiments aim to substantiate this idea.
