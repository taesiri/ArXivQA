## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Controlling nano quadrotors like Crazyflie 2.1 for precise and aggressive trajectory tracking is challenging due to complex aerodynamic disturbances and limited onboard computation. Existing methods like PID control are not sufficient. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) based on the acados software package to achieve aggressive trajectory tracking on the Crazyflie 2.1 nano quadrotor. 
- NMPC allows real-time optimization and control based on sensor measurements to account for disturbances. Acados enables efficient embedded implementation of NMPC on nano quadrotors despite limited onboard computation.

Key Contributions:
- Implements NMPC control of Crazyflie 2.1 quadrotor using acados toolbox tailored for embedded optimization.
- Divides quadrotor dynamics into separate translation and rotation models for more efficient NMPC.
- Simulation results demonstrate precise hovering and tracking of complex trajectories under disturbances.
- Hardware experiments validate aggressive trajectory tracking performance on actual 27g Crazyflie 2.1 nano quadrotor with embedded acados NMPC.

In summary, the key innovation is the use of embedded acados-based NMPC to achieve precise and aggressive trajectory tracking on computationally constrained nano quadrotors which is enabled by efficient formulation and software. The experiments highlight substantial improvements over standard methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents an aggressive trajectory tracking method for a nano-quadrotor using nonlinear model predictive control based on the acados software package, which is tested in simulation and on real hardware to demonstrate precise tracking of complex trajectories in dynamic environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an aggressive trajectory tracking method for the nano-quadrotor Crazyflie2.1 using acados based nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). Specifically:

- The paper implements NMPC on the embedded system of the nano-quadrotor Crazyflie2.1 using the acados toolbox. This allows aggressive trajectory tracking while considering the dynamics and constraints of the Crazyflie2.1 system. 

- Simulation and real-world experiments on the Crazyflie2.1 nano-quadrotor demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for accurate aggressive trajectory tracking in dynamic environments.

- The implementation of acados based embedded NMPC on nano-quadrotors is a novel contribution, as previous quadrotor control research has not focused on using acados and aggressive trajectory tracking on low-cost embedded platforms like the Crazyflie2.1.

In summary, the main contribution is using acados to implement aggressive trajectory tracking control on an embedded nano-quadrotor (Crazyflie2.1) and experimentally validating the precision and efficiency of this method.
