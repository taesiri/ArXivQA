# [Probabilistic World Modeling with Asymmetric Distance Measure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10875)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of what constitutes a good representation for planning and reasoning in a stochastic world, and how to learn such a representation. Planning and reasoning require a distance function in the representation space that accurately reflects state reachability probabilities. However, most prior representation learning work has focused on reconstructing states or modeling compatibility, not planning-oriented distance functions. 

Solutions:
1) The paper models the world as a Markov chain, which induces a directed transition graph reflecting asymmetric state reachability. It introduces a notion called C-step reachability to approximate the long-term state reachability by looking ahead C steps.

2) The paper proposes an asymmetric contrastive learning approach to embed the C-step reachability abstraction of the environment into a representation space. It uses two separate encoders to map a state into two vectors, reflecting the state's role as an incoming vs outgoing node in the directed graph. The asymmetry allows accurately modeling irreversible transitions.

3) By conditioning the embeddings on a reference state, the paper derives a symmetric distance measure from the asymmetric similarity function. This reveals geometrically salient states from different perspectives as subgoals for hierarchical planning.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizing the problem of learning representations for planning based on modeling state reachability 
- Introducing C-step reachability on Markov chains to approximate long-term reachabilities 
- Asymmetric contrastive learning approach to embed directed transition graphs 
- Reference state conditioned distance measure to identify subgoals from changing perspectives

The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of learning subgoals using the proposed representations in various gridworld environments. Future directions include using subgoals for hierarchical reinforcement learning and combining with generative models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key ideas in the paper:

The paper proposes learning asymmetric state representations that embed directed reachability graphs induced by Markov chains, allowing planning and reasoning tasks like multi-step inference and identifying subgoals from varying perspectives.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to learn state representations that capture the asymmetric state reachability in a Markov chain. Specifically:

1) The paper models the world as a Markov chain and introduces the notion of C-step reachability to approximate the long-horizon state reachability. 

2) It formulates the representation learning problem as learning an asymmetric similarity function that reflects the C-step reachability using conditional binary noise contrastive estimation (NCE). This results in two separate encoders to map states into an embedding space.

3) Based on the asymmetric similarity function, the paper develops a reference state conditioned distance measure which enables identifying geometrically salient states as subgoals from different perspectives.

4) It demonstrates the effectiveness of the learned representations and distance measure on subgoal discovery in gridworld environments. By performing density-based clustering using the proposed distance, it can successfully identify bottlenecks and passages with low reachability as subgoals.

In summary, the key innovation is an asymmetric contrastive learning approach to embed the directed reachability graph induced by a Markov chain, which supports planning, reasoning and identification of subgoals. The learned representations capture a perspective-dependent geometric abstraction of the environment dynamics.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper models the world as a Markov chain. What are the assumptions and limitations of using a Markov chain to model real-world environments? How could the method be extended to relax the Markov assumption?

2. The concept of C-step reachability is introduced to approximate the true reachability between states. What is the trade-off between using a larger or smaller value for C? Under what conditions would you expect using an infinite C to break down? 

3. The paper uses separate encoders φ and ψ to map states to the latent space. What is the intuition behind having separate encodings instead of a shared encoder? Could a single nonlinear transformation of one encoding work just as well?

4. Binary noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) is used to learn the asymmetric similarity function. How does binary NCE compare to other contrastive methods like ranking NCE or triplet loss in the context of this task?

5. The negative distribution Pn(X) is important for training the NCE classifier. The paper found PX(X) works best - why might this distribution be better suited than PY(X) or Uniform(X)?

6. The reference state conditioned distance measure dr(·,·) enables symmetric distances to be derived from the asymmetric similarity function. What properties would this measure have if the reference state r was sampled from different distributions?

7. Subgoals are identified by finding low density clusters in the latent space w.r.t. dr(·,·). What are other potential ways subgoals could be identified using the proposed representations?

8. Could the idea of reference state conditioned distance measures be applied in other graph embedding algorithms like Node2Vec or graph neural networks? What changes would need to be made?

9. The method is evaluated on gridworld environments. What additional challenges do you expect in applying this approach to high-dimensional continuous environments like robotics control tasks?

10. The paper focuses on learning representations for planning and reasoning. How could the proposed ideas be integrated into model-based reinforcement learning algorithms? What benefits would you expect?
