# [Dynamic DNNs and Runtime Management for Efficient Inference on   Mobile/Embedded Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08965)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Efficient deployment of DNNs on resource-constrained mobile/embedded devices is challenging due to dynamic hardware resource availability at runtime and varying performance requirements of different applications. 

- Hardware resource availability fluctuates at runtime due to changing workloads on multi-core SoCs. This makes it difficult to consistently meet performance targets using static model compression.

- Different applications (e.g. translation, chatbots) require different tradeoffs from the same DNN backbone model. Static models cannot adapt to these changing requirements.

Proposed Solution:
- A runtime system with three layers - application (dynamic DNNs), device (SoC), and runtime management. The layers are connected through knobs and monitors.

- Novel dynamic super-networks that can efficiently scale to match hardware availability by sampling sub-networks from a master network. avoids retraining.

- Sub-network libraries for different SoC cores - most efficient architectures are different on CPU, GPU etc. quick core switching.  

- Hierarchical runtime manager jointly tunes dynamic DNNs and DVFS to meet performance targets under hardware constraints.

Key Contributions:
- System-level optimization spanning algorithms, hardware and runtime management for adaptive DNN inference.

- Dynamic super-networks and fast cross-platform sub-network libraries avoid cost of retraining dynamic models.

- Joint optimization of dynamic neural networks and hardware knobs (DVFS, mapping) at runtime.

The proposed runtime system with dynamic super-networks provides efficient and flexible DNN inference on resource-constrained mobile devices by coordinating algorithms and hardware.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a runtime system with dynamic neural networks and resource management to efficiently deploy DNNs on mobile and embedded devices by dynamically adjusting model architectures and hardware resources to meet changing performance constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content in the paper, the main contribution is "system-level performance trade-off management". Specifically:

1) The paper proposes a runtime system that combines dynamic neural networks and runtime hardware resource management to achieve efficient inference on mobile/embedded devices. 

2) The key idea is to have a central runtime management layer that can tune both the neural network models (by selecting different sub-networks) and the hardware (e.g. DVFS and task mapping) to meet changing performance constraints.

3) This integrated system-level approach is different from previous works that focused on optimizing individual components in isolation. The co-design of the application layer (dynamic models) and runtime management layer based on hardware characterization is a key contribution.

4) The paper also proposes a novel "Dynamic Super-network" method to construct efficient dynamic neural networks without separate training for each sub-network. This addresses limitations of prior dynamic network techniques.

In summary, the main highlight is the system-level perspective for runtime performance management, instead of just optimizing individual components. The co-design and characterization-based approach allows maximizing the efficiency and flexibility trade-offs holistically.
