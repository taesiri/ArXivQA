# [Transformer tricks: Precomputing the first layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13388)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method to speed up inference for large language models that use relative position encodings (such as LLaMA, Mistral, PaLM, and Gemma). The key idea is to precompute and store parts of the first transformer layer, which saves computation during inference. 

The Problem:
Large transformer models are computationally expensive, especially during autoregressive inference when generating text token-by-token. Improving inference speed allows these models to be deployed more widely.

The Proposed Solution: 
For transformers using relative position encodings, much of the computation in the first layer depends only on the input embeddings. By precomputing the outputs of the feedforward network (FFN) and the query/key/value transformations and storing them instead of the embeddings, each inference step now requires fewer computations and memory reads.

Main Contributions:
- Shows how to precompute parts of the first transformer layer for models using either parallel or non-parallel attention.
- Analyzes computational savings, which can be a 11,000x reduction in reads for batch size 1, and 3-6% total parameter memory reduction.
- Provides examples for large models like Mistral-7B and Pythia-6.9B, showing the potential speedups.
- Notes that relative savings decreases for models with more layers, but absolute savings stays roughly constant.

In summary, this short paper introduces an effective trick to accelerate inference for large transformer language models by precomputing portions of the initial transformations based on the observation that they depend only on fixed input embeddings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes precomputing parts of the first transformer layer to reduce compute and memory bandwidth during inference, resulting in faster and cheaper transformer models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is a method to speed up inference of transformers with relative position encodings (RoPE) by precomputing parts of the first transformer layer. 

Specifically, for transformers with parallel attention and feedforward layers (like GPT-J, Pythia, PaLM), the paper shows how the feedforward network and the query, key, and value transformations in the multi-head attention can be precomputed. This reduces the number of computations and memory reads per token during inference.

For transformers without parallel attention/FFN (like LLaMA, Mistral, Mixtral), the paper shows how at least the query, key, and value transformations can be precomputed to reduce computations and memory reads.

So in summary, the main contribution is introducing and analyzing this "transformer trick" of precomputing parts of the first layer to optimize inference speed and cost. The paper includes examples with models like Pythia, Mistral, and Mixtral to quantify the potential savings.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and topics associated with it include:

- Precomputing transformer layers - The main focus of the paper is on precomputing the first layer of transformers to reduce computation and memory bandwidth.

- RoPE (Rotary Positional Encoding) - The precomputation technique relies on using RoPE instead of absolute positional encodings. 

- Parallel vs serial transformer architectures - The paper discusses precomputation for both parallel transformers like GPT-J and serial transformers like LLaMA.

- Attention types - Different attention mechanisms like multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention (MQA), and grouped-query attention (GQA) are mentioned.

- Large language models - The technique is applied to models like Pythia, Mistral, Mixtral, PaLM which are large language models in the billions of parameters.

- Inference optimization - A goal is to optimize inference latency, throughput, and cost by precomputing parts of the transformer.

So in summary, the key terms cover transformer architectures, attention mechanisms, large language models, and inference optimization. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that precomputing the first layer can increase or decrease total memory size depending on vocabulary size and eliminated weights. Can you provide a more detailed mathematical analysis of the memory tradeoffs with precomputing? What are the key factors that determine whether memory increases or decreases?

2. The reduction factors for memory reads with precomputing seem very large especially for low batch sizes. But how do these theoretical reductions translate to actual wall-clock speedups? What hardware/systems factors influence the real-world speedups? 

3. For the serial transformer, you precompute the query, key and value transformations but not the FFN. What is the rationale behind only precomputing the attention and not the FFN? Would there be additional benefits or challenges with also precomputing the FFN?

4. The method seems most beneficial for very large models with many layers, where savings in the first layer are amortized over more layers. For smaller 4-8 layer models, would you still recommend using this trick? What are the practical tradeoffs?

5. You focused on optimizing inference in this paper. How does precomputing the first layer affect fine-tuning and training of these large language models? Are there any benefits or downsides compared to the normal approach?

6. Could precomputing the first layer help enable deployment of these very large models to resource constrained environments like mobile phones or embedded devices? What would be the practical obstacles to overcome?

7. The memory reductions seem largest for batch size 1. In practice, what batch sizes are typically used during inference for real-world transformer deployments? Will those see similar memory reductions?  

8. What are the software engineering challenges with precomputing the first layer offline and integrating it into existing codebases optimized for normal transformer execution?

9. For extremely large future models beyond the scale you experimented on, do you foresee any scalability issues or bottlenecks with precomputing the first layer? Would optimizations be needed?

10. Are there any risks associated with precomputing parts of the model offline before deployment related to model quality or security? How would you mitigate those?
