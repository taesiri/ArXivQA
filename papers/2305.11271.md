# Towards Collaborative Plan Acquisition through Theory of Mind Modeling   in Situated Dialogue

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can humans and AI agents effectively collaborate and communicate to establish shared plans for joint tasks when starting from incomplete knowledge or abilities?The paper introduces a new problem formulation called "collaborative plan acquisition" (CPA) to study how humans and AI agents can learn and communicate to acquire a complete shared plan. The main hypotheses seem to be:1) Modeling communicative intentions through dialogue moves will help with theory of mind (ToM) modeling and collaborative plan acquisition. 2) Predicting a partner's missing knowledge is more effective than predicting one's own missing knowledge for collaborative plan acquisition. 3) Explicitly modeling a partner's mental states and dialogue moves leads to improved and more stable collaborative plan acquisition compared to not modeling them.The paper aims to investigate computational strategies for collaborative plan acquisition in situated dialogue through the CPA formulation. The goal is to provide insight into how future AI agents could leverage theory of mind modeling and dialogue to establish common ground and shared plans with human partners.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is formulating and investigating the problem of collaborative plan acquisition in human-AI teams. Specifically:- The paper introduces a new task called collaborative plan acquisition (CPA), where humans and AI agents with disparate knowledge and skills need to communicate and coordinate to construct a complete plan for joint tasks. - The paper extends an existing benchmark called MindCraft for studying theory of mind in collaborative tasks. Additional annotations for fine-grained dialogue moves are added to capture communicative intentions.- A computational model is developed that takes multimodal input of perceptual observations, dialogue history, and partial plans, and predicts missing task knowledge for self and for the partner. - Empirical results suggest predicting the partner's missing knowledge is more viable than predicting one's own. Modeling the partner's mental states and dialogue moves leads to improved performance in knowledge prediction.- The paper provides insights on effective collaboration strategies where agents proactively share knowledge that their partner is missing, which facilitates establishing common ground.In summary, the key contribution is formulating collaborative plan acquisition in situated human-AI teams and investigating computational strategies based on theory of mind modeling and dialogue understanding. The results provide implications for developing AI agents that can collaborate effectively with humans.
