# [Towards Collaborative Plan Acquisition through Theory of Mind Modeling   in Situated Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11271)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can humans and AI agents effectively collaborate and communicate to establish shared plans for joint tasks when starting from incomplete knowledge or abilities?

The paper introduces a new problem formulation called "collaborative plan acquisition" (CPA) to study how humans and AI agents can learn and communicate to acquire a complete shared plan. The main hypotheses seem to be:

1) Modeling communicative intentions through dialogue moves will help with theory of mind (ToM) modeling and collaborative plan acquisition. 

2) Predicting a partner's missing knowledge is more effective than predicting one's own missing knowledge for collaborative plan acquisition. 

3) Explicitly modeling a partner's mental states and dialogue moves leads to improved and more stable collaborative plan acquisition compared to not modeling them.

The paper aims to investigate computational strategies for collaborative plan acquisition in situated dialogue through the CPA formulation. The goal is to provide insight into how future AI agents could leverage theory of mind modeling and dialogue to establish common ground and shared plans with human partners.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is formulating and investigating the problem of collaborative plan acquisition in human-AI teams. Specifically:

- The paper introduces a new task called collaborative plan acquisition (CPA), where humans and AI agents with disparate knowledge and skills need to communicate and coordinate to construct a complete plan for joint tasks. 

- The paper extends an existing benchmark called MindCraft for studying theory of mind in collaborative tasks. Additional annotations for fine-grained dialogue moves are added to capture communicative intentions.

- A computational model is developed that takes multimodal input of perceptual observations, dialogue history, and partial plans, and predicts missing task knowledge for self and for the partner. 

- Empirical results suggest predicting the partner's missing knowledge is more viable than predicting one's own. Modeling the partner's mental states and dialogue moves leads to improved performance in knowledge prediction.

- The paper provides insights on effective collaboration strategies where agents proactively share knowledge that their partner is missing, which facilitates establishing common ground.

In summary, the key contribution is formulating collaborative plan acquisition in situated human-AI teams and investigating computational strategies based on theory of mind modeling and dialogue understanding. The results provide implications for developing AI agents that can collaborate effectively with humans.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to other related work:

- The paper tackles the problem of collaborative plan acquisition, where agents need to coordinate and communicate to acquire a complete plan from initial disparate knowledge. This bridges collaborative planning and situated dialogue in a novel way compared to prior work.

- The paper uses the Minecraft environment as the planning domain. This allows complex hierarchical plans and perception in a 3D block world, unlike many previous datasets based on plan libraries or more abstract planning domains.

- The agents play symmetrical roles, both acting and communicating, rather than having a passive observer or speaker/listener setup. This is more realistic than much prior work on plan and goal recognition or theory of mind.

- The paper focuses on natural language communication, rather than just actions/effects for plan recognition. It also annotates and models fine-grained dialogue moves, going beyond prior work that uses more high-level parsed language. 

- The collaborative plan acquisition formulation gets at completing partial plans through communication. Most prior goal and plan recognition research doesn't consider incomplete plans or situated language.

- For theory of mind, prior work looks at inferring beliefs or predicting actions. This paper relates theory of mind to acquiring collaborative plans through dialogue, a novel focus.

- The empirical results provide insight on effective collaboration strategies, like inferring then communicating a partner's missing knowledge. This goes beyond most prior theory of mind evaluations.

In summary, this paper connects several areas in a new way - collaborative planning, situated dialogue, plan/goal recognition, and theory of mind. The problem formulation, environment, agent roles, and empirical findings advance the state of the art and offer insights for human-AI collaboration.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring approaches that incorporate AND-OR graphs to account for alternative paths to achieving joint goals. The current setup assumes a single optimal complete plan, but allowing for alternative valid plans could make the framework more realistic.

- Extending the models trained on human-human data to human-AI collaboration. Since AI agents have limited perception and reasoning compared to humans, there may be more repetitions, confirmations, and corrections that the models need to handle. 

- Refining and evaluating in more detail the proposed collaborative strategy where agents predict and communicate missing knowledge to their partner while also prompting for their partner's missing knowledge. This mutual approach could improve common ground.

- Incorporating large foundation models into the framework to facilitate more natural situated dialogue for collaborative plan acquisition. Evaluating these models in complex human-agent collaboration is an open area.

- Moving beyond the current dyadic scenario to allow modeling and coordination between multiple agents.

- Generalizing the collaborative plan acquisition framework to more complex tasks with less structured forms of partial knowledge and plans.

Overall, the authors highlight the need to test their approach in more open-ended collaborative scenarios with less idealized assumptions, integrate more flexible language models, and extend the modeling to multi-agent interactions. Advancing human-AI collaboration through natural communication is a key theme.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a novel approach for collaborative plan acquisition between humans and AI agents. The key idea is that humans and agents start with incomplete and disparate knowledge about a collaborative task, and must communicate through natural language dialogue to coordinate and acquire a complete shared plan. The authors formulate the collaborative plan acquisition problem, where agents must predict their own and their partner's missing knowledge based on perceptual context and dialogue history. They extend an existing collaborative task benchmark called MindCraft with additional dialogue move annotations to capture communicative intentions. A computational model is developed that incorporates predicting dialogue moves and mental states to perform collaborative plan acquisition. Experiments demonstrate that predicting the partner's missing knowledge is more viable than predicting one's own knowledge. Modeling the partner's mental states and dialogue moves improves performance and stability over time versus a baseline model. The results provide insight into effective strategies for future AI agents to collaborate with humans - by inferring and communicating the partner's missing knowledge while prompting them for their own missing knowledge. This mutual approach facilitates acquiring a shared understanding of joint tasks.

In summary, this paper makes contributions in collaborative planning for human-AI teams. It proposes the novel task of collaborative plan acquisition, where agents must leverage perceptual context and dialogue history to predict missing knowledge and achieve a complete shared plan. Experiments demonstrate the benefit of modeling communicative intentions and a partner's mental states. The findings will facilitate more effective coordination between humans and AI agents in collaborative tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a method for collaborative plan acquisition in human-AI teams. The key idea is for agents to predict missing task knowledge for themselves and their partner based on perceptual and dialogue history. The method uses a sequence model that takes as input representations of the visual environment, dialogue exchanges, and each agent's partial plan graph. The model is trained to predict the partner's dialogue moves, mental states, and missing knowledge. A key finding is that predicting the partner's missing knowledge produces better results than predicting one's own missing knowledge. The approach shows that modeling the partner's mental states and dialogue intentions helps acquire more complete and stable joint plans over the course of situated interactions. Overall, the method demonstrates the viability of agents proactively sharing knowledge to facilitate mutual understanding and successful collaboration with human partners.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to enable effective collaboration and communication between humans and AI agents, particularly embodied agents like robots, when they have different skills, knowledge, and partial understandings of a collaborative task. 

The key questions seem to be:

- How can agents acquire the missing knowledge needed to form a complete plan for joint tasks, both for themselves and for their human partner?

- How can they communicate this missing knowledge to each other effectively through natural language dialogue in order to reach a shared understanding?

- What computational models and strategies are most effective for an agent to predict what knowledge their partner is missing and proactively share that to facilitate seamless collaboration?

The authors point out that collaborative tasks often start with humans and agents having incomplete knowledge and plans. Bridging this gap is difficult, especially when it involves situated dialogue and physical activities. So the paper introduces a new problem formulation called "collaborative plan acquisition" to study how agents can learn and communicate to acquire a complete shared plan.
