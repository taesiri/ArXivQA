# [ElasticViT: Conflict-aware Supernet Training for Deploying Fast Vision   Transformer on Diverse Mobile Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09730)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we effectively train a high-quality vision transformer (ViT) supernet that can support both tiny and large ViT models for diverse mobile devices with varying computational capabilities?

The key challengesidentified in training such a supernet are:

- Training over an extremely large search space that includes both tiny and large ViT models results in performance degradation due to optimization interference between subnets of vastly different sizes.

- The typical supernet training techniques like sandwich rule sampling can cause large differences in model sizes between the sampled subnets, leading to gradient conflicts. 

To address these issues, the paper proposes two main techniques:

1) Complexity-aware sampling to constrain the FLOPs differences between subnets sampled across training steps, while still covering different subnet sizes. This is done using adjacent step sampling and a hierarchical smallest subnet set.

2) Performance-aware sampling to sample good subnets and reduce gradient conflicts, by using a quality-aware memory bank and ViT architecture preference rule.

By applying these techniques to train a mobile-specialized ViT supernet, the paper demonstrates superior performance of the discovered ViT models on ImageNet classification and across diverse mobile devices compared to prior efficient CNN and ViT models.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that by designing effective techniques to train a very large ViT supernet, it is possible to obtain high-quality tiny and large ViT models suited for diverse mobile devices. The proposed complexity-aware and performance-aware sampling techniques validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes ElasticViT, a two-stage NAS approach to train a high-quality vision transformer (ViT) supernet and search for optimal subnetworks that achieve high accuracy and low latency on mobile devices. 

2. It identifies the key issue of gradient conflict when training a very large ViT supernet covering both small and large models, which causes poor performance. The paper provides an analysis on the root causes of gradient conflict.

3. To address the gradient conflict issue, the paper proposes two techniques: complexity-aware sampling to constrain FLOPs differences between subnets, and performance-aware sampling to favor good subnets during training. These enhance supernet training.

4. Experiments demonstrate ElasticViT models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy under mobile latency constraints, outperforming prior efficient CNNs and ViTs. Tiny and small ElasticViT models are the first to surpass CNNs in accuracy and speed within 200MFLOPs.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing techniques to train even larger ViT supernets that can cover an even wider diversity of mobile devices and capabilities. The authors mention their supernet is 10^7x larger than typical NAS supernets, but covering an even greater range of devices could be useful.

- Exploring methods to enhance the performance-aware sampling scheme to sample subnets with even higher potential accuracy. The authors propose some techniques here like the preference rule and memory bank, but more advanced methods could help improve supernet training further.

- Applying the proposed conflict-aware supernet training techniques to other model families beyond ViTs, like CNNs. The authors focus on ViT here but the ideas could generalize.

- Evaluating the approach on more complex vision tasks beyond image classification, like object detection and segmentation. The authors demonstrate promising ImageNet classification results but assessing performance on other tasks is an area for future work.

- Further improving the efficiency of the searched ViT models through techniques like knowledge distillation, quantization, and pruning. The authors obtain efficient models through the architecture search but additional optimizations could help.

- Deploying the models on more mobile devices and platforms to evaluate real-world efficiency. The authors test on a few devices but validation on more hardware can help drive adoption.

In general, the paper develops some nice techniques for conflict-aware supernet training but applying and extending these ideas to larger supernets, other models, more tasks, and greater efficiency optimizations represent interesting areas for future research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes ElasticViT, a novel two-stage neural architecture search (NAS) approach to automatically design accurate and low-latency vision transformers (ViTs) for diverse mobile devices. It introduces a very large search space covering tiny to large ViTs to accommodate mobile devices with varying computational capabilities. However, directly training a supernet on this vast space leads to poor performance due to gradient conflicts caused by subnets with vastly different model sizes being uniformly sampled during training. To address this, ElasticViT proposes two key techniques: 1) complexity-aware sampling, which limits the FLOPs differences between sampled subnets across training steps, and uses multiple smallest subnets to avoid large FLOPs gaps; 2) performance-aware sampling, which samples subnets likely to have higher accuracy based on a ViT architecture preference rule and quality-aware memory bank. Experiments show ElasticViT models achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet accuracy under mobile latency constraints, significantly outperforming prior efficient CNNs and ViTs. The techniques also demonstrably improve supernet training quality. Overall, ElasticViT enables accurate and fast vision transformers on diverse mobile devices.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes ElasticViT, a two-stage neural architecture search (NAS) approach to train a high-quality vision transformer (ViT) supernet and search for optimal subnetworks that achieve high accuracy under low latency constraints on mobile devices. The key challenge is training a supernet over an extremely large search space that covers tiny to large ViTs. The authors find that using uniform sampling like prior works suffers from gradient conflicts between subnets with vastly different sizes. To address this, they propose two techniques: 1) Complexity-aware sampling that constrains the FLOPs differences between subnets sampled in adjacent steps, while still covering diverse sizes. It uses a multiple-min strategy to sample smallest subnets close to the FLOPs at each step. 2) Performance-aware sampling that further reduces gradient conflicts by sampling potentially good subnets using a preference rule and memory bank. The preference rule favors wider and shallower ViTs based on empirical observations. The memory bank stores historical good subnets. With conflict-aware sampling, ElasticViT is able to train high-quality ViT supernet over a very large space. It searches subnets that achieve SOTA ImageNet accuracy under latency constraints on mobile devices.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key problem this paper is addressing is how to train high-quality vision transformer (ViT) models that can achieve both high accuracy and low latency across a diverse range of mobile devices. 

Specifically, the paper points out two main challenges:

1. Mobile devices have vastly different computation capabilities, ranging from high-end to low-end devices. This requires the search space to cover both tiny and large ViT models to accommodate different devices. 

2. Training a supernet over such an extremely large search space leads to poor performance due to "gradient conflict" between subnets with vastly different sizes.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes a new NAS approach called ElasticViT. The key ideas are:

1. Design an optimized mobile-friendly ViT search space that covers models ranging from 37M to 3G FLOPs. This is 10^7 times larger than typical NAS search spaces.

2. Propose two new techniques - complexity-aware sampling and performance-aware sampling - to address the gradient conflict issue by limiting FLOPs differences between subnets and sampling good subnets during supernet training.

3. Show on ImageNet that ElasticViT models achieve much higher accuracy under similar latency constraints compared to prior efficient CNNs and ViTs. The models also transfer well to other datasets.

In summary, the key contributions are proposing a NAS approach to automate the design of accurate and low-latency ViT models that can efficiently serve diverse mobile devices, through a very large search space and conflict-aware supernet training techniques.
