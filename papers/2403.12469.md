# [When Do "More Contexts" Help with Sarcasm Recognition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12469)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Sarcasm recognition is challenging because it requires understanding the true intent behind words, which is often opposite or different from the literal meaning. 
- Prior work has tried to address this by providing more contextual information (e.g. sentiment, cultural nuances) to models, but there lacks a systematic study evaluating the collective effectiveness of these methods. It's unclear which methods to prioritize and what the possibilities/impossibilities are in further improving performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a framework to integrate four representative approaches for incorporating richer contexts: (1) word embeddings capturing sentiment, (2) sentence embeddings from language models, (3) improved sentence embeddings via contrastive learning, (4) combining all embeddings.  
- Evaluate approaches on 3 sarcasm recognition benchmarks to analyze the impact of additional contexts.
- Manually analyze test samples to understand possibilities and impossibilities - where models fail even with more contexts.

Key Contributions:
- Achieve existing state-of-the-art performance by simply combining more contextual embeddings. Suggests prior work gains may just be from more data rather than technique.
- Find sentence embeddings more effective than word embeddings, and embeddings learned from more sarcastic data offer more gains. Contrastive learning brings negligible gains.  
- Discover failures attributed to models needing to learn societal biases. Highlights need to rethink pursuing further performance gains if requiring undesirable biases.
- Underscores importance of future work to develop unbiased sarcasm detection and investigate introduction of biases.
