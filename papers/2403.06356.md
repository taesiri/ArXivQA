# [Video Generation with Consistency Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06356)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating long and high-quality videos from text prompts remains challenging. Existing methods tend to produce videos with jitter, noise and lack of consistency between frames. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes an automated video processing framework with four key modules to address the limitations of current video generation models:

1. Separate Tuning Module: Employs a diffusion model to generate initial video frames from the text prompt. Then segments each frame into foreground and background using semantic segmentation.

2. Average Fusion Module: Creates an optimized frame by fusing the foreground of a frame with averaged backgrounds sampled from other frames. This enhances inter-frame consistency.  

3. Combined Tuning Module: Further fine-tunes the diffusion model using a composite loss function that applies separate losses to the foreground and background regions. This improves video quality.

4. Inter-Frame Consistency Module: Models the entire video as overlapping short clips and optimizes video generation by enforcing consistency between frames that are common across clips. This reduces flickering and jitter.

By applying these modules in sequence, the framework is able to generate longer, more consistent and higher-quality videos compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main Contributions:
- A new automated video processing pipeline with four complementary modules that improve long video generation.
- Novel average fusion and separate tuning strategies to explicitly model and optimize foreground/background consistency.  
- Demonstrates improved visual quality and inter-frame consistency compared to recent methods.

The paper shows promising initial results, and aims to fully evaluate the complete framework in future work.
