# [Autoregressive Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02037)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a generative modeling approach that combines the benefits of autoregressive models and diffusion models, while avoiding some of their limitations?Specifically, the paper introduces Autoregressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) as a new model class that encompasses and generalizes order-agnostic autoregressive models and absorbing discrete diffusion. The key benefits highlighted of ARDMs are:- They do not require a pre-specified order for generation like standard autoregressive models, making them more flexible. - They can be trained efficiently on just a single step of the likelihood bound, similar to modern diffusion models. This allows scaling to high-dimensional data.- They require significantly fewer steps than discrete diffusion models to attain the same performance.- Sampling and inference can be parallelized, enabling applications like competitive lossless compression with modest compute.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that ARDMs can combine strengths of autoregressive and diffusion models to enable flexible and efficient generation and inference on complex, high-dimensional datasets. The paper aims to introduce ARDMs and empirically validate these potential benefits.
