# [Harder Tasks Need More Experts: Dynamic Routing in MoE Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07652)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Harder Tasks Need More Experts: Dynamic Routing in MoE Models":

Problem:
- Traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models use fixed top-k routing to activate a predetermined number of experts per input token, regardless of the input complexity. This is computationally inefficient.
- Different layers of transformer models may require a different number of experts for optimal performance.

Proposed Solution:
- A dynamic routing mechanism that activates a variable number of experts based on the model's confidence in expert selection for each input token.
- More experts are activated for tokens the model is less confident about, indicating more complex inputs. Fewer experts for simpler tokens.
- A dynamic loss is introduced to encourage activating only necessary experts.
- The routing mechanism tends to activate more experts in lower layers to obtain better shallow representations, and fewer experts in higher layers to avoid overthinking.

Main Contributions:
- The proposed dynamic routing method substantially outperforms fixed top-k routing, achieving 0.7% higher performance on average while using fewer parameters.
- Analysis shows the model activates more experts for complex reasoning tasks, confirming its ability to dynamically allocate resources based on difficulty.
- Findings suggest the potential for developing heterogeneous MoE models, with different computational requirements per layer.
- The dynamic allocation across layers also mitigates overthinking in deep networks.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient and high-performing dynamic routing mechanism for MoE models that can tailor expert activation to the complexity of inputs and representations in different layers. This facilitates more rational resource allocation and advances MoE-based language models.
