# [Towards More Practical Group Activity Detection: A New Benchmark and   Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02878)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Cafë, a new large-scale dataset for the task of group activity detection (GAD) in videos. GAD involves both localizing groups by identifying the members as well as classifying the activity of each group. The Cafë dataset contains over 10K video clips taken from six different cafes captured by four cameras with varying viewpoints. The dataset has rich annotations including 3.5M bounding boxes, track IDs, group configurations, and activity labels across six common group activities. Compared to prior GAD datasets, Cafë has more non-singleton groups, presenting more realistic and challenging evaluation scenarios. In addition to the dataset, the authors propose a new GAD model based on Transformers that handles an unknown number of groups effectively without relying on offline clustering methods. The model learns embedding spaces where actors belonging to the same group have high affinity. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on Cafë as well as two other benchmarks in terms of both accuracy and speed. Both the Cafë dataset and code will be made publicly available to facilitate future research on this practical and challenging problem.
