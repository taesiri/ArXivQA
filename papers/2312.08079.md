# [Extending Whisper with prompt tuning to target-speaker ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08079)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes using prompt tuning to extend Whisper, a large-scale single-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, to target-speaker ASR (TS-ASR) for transcribing the speech of a target speaker from multi-talker overlapped utterances. The method introduces trainable soft prompts conditioned on target speaker embeddings to guide Whisper to focus on the target speech. Techniques like deep prompting and prompt reparameterization are further explored to enhance performance. Experiments on the Libri2Mix dataset demonstrate the proposed approach achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art full fine-tuning TS-ASR methods while only fine-tuning about 1% task-specific parameters. Notably, the method retains Whisper's original abilities of inverse text normalization and timestamp prediction, enabling more natural and informative transcriptions. The work underscores prompt tuning's effectiveness and efficiency for adapting large foundation models to new tasks when data is limited. It also extends Whisper's remarkable transferability to the challenging TS-ASR task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a prompt tuning approach to extend Whisper, a large-scale single-talker ASR model, to target-speaker ASR of multi-talker overlapped speech, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while only tuning about 1% task-specific parameters and retaining Whisper's abilities like inverse text normalization and timestamp prediction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a prompting scheme to extend the single-talker ASR model Whisper to target-speaker ASR for multi-talker overlapped speech. Specifically:

1) The authors propose to use prompt tuning together with deep prompting and reparameterization techniques to guide Whisper to perform target-speaker ASR with only a small number of task-specific parameters. 

2) The proposed prompting scheme achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art full fine-tuning methods while being much more parameter-efficient (only tuning about 1% task-specific parameters).

3) The original capabilities of Whisper, such as inverse text normalization and timestamp prediction, are retained after prompting, keeping the generated transcriptions natural and informative.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a parameter-efficient prompting scheme to extend the single-talker ASR model Whisper to target-speaker ASR while retaining Whisper's original features, demonstrating the promise of prompt tuning for speech processing.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using prompt tuning to extend Whisper to target-speaker ASR. Why is prompt tuning suitable for this task compared to other parameter-efficient tuning methods like adapter tuning or BitFit? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using prompt tuning here?

2. The paper inserts target speaker embeddings and soft prompts at both the encoder and decoder. What is the motivation behind inserting prompts at both locations instead of just one? How do the encoder and decoder prompts play different roles in guiding the model?

3. Deep prompting is used in this method to replace intermediate layer output vectors with soft prompts. How does this help improve performance compared to just having prompts at the input? What are the tradeoffs introduced by using deep prompting?

4. The paper finds that using separate MLPs to reparameterize each layer's soft prompts works better than a shared MLP. Why might this be the case? What are the differences in how a shared vs separate MLPs constraint and enable inter-layer variations?

5. The prompt length is set to 16 based on performance vs efficiency tradeoffs. How might you determine the optimal prompt length? What factors influence what prompt length strikes the best balance?

6. The ablation study shows prompting location impacts performance - encoder prompts play a bigger role than decoder prompts. Why might this asymmetry exist? What does this suggest about how guidance signals at different locations propagate through the model?

7. The method retains Whisper's abilities like inverse text normalization by training on Whisper-labeled texts. How does this help retain these auxiliary prediction capabilities? What is the limitation imposed by using manually labeled texts?

8. How suitable is the proposed method for a production TS-ASR system? What practical considerations around computational efficiency, robustness, and flexibility need to be taken into account?

9. The method uses speaker embeddings derived from external speaker verification models. How could the speaker embeddings be learned in an end-to-end fashion along with the prompts? What are the tradeoffs?

10. How could the prompting scheme proposed here be extended to other speech tasks like speech translation or speech enhancement? What components would need to change or stay the same?
