# [Flexible Visual Recognition by Evidential Modeling of Confusion and   Ignorance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07403)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we develop a deep learning model for visual recognition that can flexibly provide predictive sets (either reject making a prediction or make multiple predictions) by separately quantifying two key sources of uncertainty - confusion and ignorance?The key ideas and contributions in addressing this research question appear to be:- Propose explicitly modeling confusion and ignorance for flexible visual recognition using Subjective Logic framework. - Define confusion as conflicting evidence shared between known classes and ignorance as total lack of evidence. - Model hypothesis space using multiple plausibility functions to avoid combinatorial complexity in estimating confusion.- Learn concentration parameters of Dirichlet priors placed on singleton beliefs. Derive full set of opinions including confusion, ignorance via evidence combination rules.- Demonstrate effectiveness on tasks like open set detection, handling misclassifications, adversarial attacks by separately leveraging confusion and ignorance estimates.In summary, the paper develops an evidential modeling approach to achieve flexible visual recognition by separately quantifying two key uncertainties - confusion and ignorance. This provides the flexibility to reject unknown samples or make multiple predictions when unsure for known classes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach to model two distinct sources of uncertainty - confusion and ignorance - for flexible visual recognition. The key ideas are:- Confusion is defined as conflicting evidence that contributes to multiple classes while not being discriminative between them. Ignorance refers to the total lack of evidence. - The training of a recognition model is viewed as an evidence collecting process. Plausibility functions are introduced to predict per-class evidence, from which confusion and ignorance can be derived via evidence combination rules.- The model learns to estimate the concentration parameters of a Dirichlet prior placed on singleton class beliefs. The training loss includes the prior likelihood, a regularization term, and a KL divergence term.- During inference, the predicted plausibility functions can be combined to obtain a comprehensive set of opinions including singleton beliefs, inter-class confusions, and ignorance.- The explicitly modeled confusion and ignorance allow the system to flexibly reject unknown samples or make multiple predictions on uncertain in-distribution samples.In summary, the key novelty is separately modeling confusion and ignorance for flexible visual recognition, instead of lumping all uncertainty into a single term. Experiments validate the ability to quantify and compare the two sources of uncertainty.
