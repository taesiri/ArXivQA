# [Improved Efficient Two-Stage Denoising Diffusion Power System   Measurement Recovery Against False Data Injection Attacks and Data Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04346)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an improved two-stage denoising diffusion model called TSDM for accurately recovering power system measurements that have been corrupted by false data injection attacks or lost due to communication issues. TSDM utilizes the strong generation capabilities of diffusion models to extract spatio-temporal correlations between measurements. The first stage detects and eliminates outliers using a classifier-guided conditional diffusion process. The second stage fills in missing data entries through a diffusion-based imputation approach. TSDM enhances the standard denoising diffusion implicit model by estimating precise means and optimal variances to accelerate the diffusion process. Extensive case studies on IEEE test systems demonstrate that compared to methods like LSTM, VAE, GAN, and ADMM, TSDM achieves significantly higher accuracy in recovering both steady-state SCADA measurements under renewable integration as well as highly dynamic PMU measurements under complex contingencies. Moreover, TSDM maintains strong robustness against high corruption ratios while reducing computational complexity through subsequence acceleration strategies. The ability to rectify corrupted inputs makes TSDM suitable for ensuring reliable state estimation and facilitating monitoring, protection, and control actions in modern power systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes an improved two-stage denoising diffusion model to accurately recover power system measurements from false data injection attacks and data losses under complex dynamics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It proposes a novel two-stage architecture for power system measurement recovery. The first stage uses a classifier-guided conditional diffusion component to detect and rectify outliers. The second stage uses a measurement imputation diffusion component to synthesize missing data. 

2. Both stages are based on an enhanced denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) with low-length subsequences. This model adopts Bayesian theorem to estimate the precise mean and optimal variance in order to accelerate the data generation process. 

3. The proposed two-stage denoising diffusion model (TSDM) demonstrates superior performance in recovering SCADA measurements of renewable energy integrated power systems, as well as recovering PMU measurements with highly nonlinear dynamics under complex contingencies. Extensive case studies validate its effectiveness.

In summary, the key innovation is the design of an improved two-stage diffusion model architecture that leverages conditional denoising and optimal variance strategies to achieve efficient and accurate power system measurement recovery.
