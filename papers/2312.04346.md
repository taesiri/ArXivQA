# [Improved Efficient Two-Stage Denoising Diffusion Power System   Measurement Recovery Against False Data Injection Attacks and Data Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04346)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Power system measurements can be corrupted by cyber-attacks (false data injection attacks) or data losses due to communication issues. This degrades the quality of measurements and affects monitoring, protection, and control applications.  
- Existing methods for recovering corrupted power system measurements have limitations in accuracy, applicability, and computational efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Two-Stage Denoising Diffusion Recovery Model (TSDM) to accurately recover power system measurements under false data injection attacks and data losses.

- Stage 1 uses a classifier-guided conditional diffusion component to detect and rectify outliers. It recovers measurements and computes differences with original data to identify outliers using 3Ïƒ testing.

- Stage 2 uses a diffusion-based imputation, leveraging correlations in data, to synthesize missing data snippets when outlier proportion is over 10%. 

- Both stages use an improved Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) with subsequences and optimal variances to accelerate diffusion trajectory and data generation.

Main Contributions:

- Novel two-stage architecture for accurate detection, rectification of outliers, and imputation of missing data entries.

- Improved DDIM model with shorter subsequences and optimal variances for efficient data generation.

- Demonstrated superior performance in recovering measurements from SCADA and PMU systems under renewable variability, cyber-attacks, communication issues, and complex contingencies.

- Stronger accuracy and robustness compared to LSTM, Autoencoders, GANs, and other methods across various case studies.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative two-stage denoising diffusion approach to recover corrupted power system measurements with high quality. By enhancing diffusion models and using a conditional diffusion technique, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
