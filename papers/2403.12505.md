# [Semantics, Distortion, and Style Matter: Towards Source-free UDA for   Panoramic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12505)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the challenging problem of source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) for panoramic semantic segmentation. SFUDA refers to adapting a source model trained on labeled source data (e.g. pinhole images) to a target domain (e.g. panoramic images) without access to the source data. Transferring knowledge from pinhole to panoramic domains is difficult due to three issues: (1) semantic mismatch caused by different fields-of-view, (2) distortion of equirectangular projection images, (3) style discrepancies between camera sensors and scenes.  

Proposed Solution:
The key idea is to leverage the multi-projection versatility of 360-degree data for efficient domain knowledge transfer. Specifically, the paper proposes to use Tangent Projection (TP) images which have less distortion, and Fixed Field-of-View Projection (FFP) images which mimic pinhole image views. A Panoramic Prototype Adaptation Module (PPAM) is introduced to obtain global prototypes from TP and FFP images for adaptation. Prediction and prototype losses are imposed to transfer knowledge. A Cross-Dual Attention Module (CDAM) aligns spatial and channel characteristics of features to address style discrepancies.  

Main Contributions:
1) First work to tackle SFUDA for panoramic segmentation by effectively extracting and transferring knowledge between pinhole and panoramic domains.
2) Leverages TP and FFP images and proposes PPAM to obtain global panoramic prototypes for adaptation.
3) Imposes prediction, prototype losses and proposes CDAM to align features across domains and projections.
4) Experiments show the method significantly outperforms previous SFUDA approaches and is comparable to state-of-the-art UDA methods that utilize source data.
