# [ASPIRe: An Informative Trajectory Planner with Mutual Information   Approximation for Target Search and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01674)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of mobile target search and tracking (SAT) using autonomous robots in cluttered environments with limited sensing field-of-view (FOV). The key challenges are: 1) handling sensing uncertainty and target occlusion effectively for accurate state estimation, 2) generating optimal informative trajectories to maximize information gain and reduce target uncertainty, and 3) achieving real-time performance for online replanning.

Proposed Solution - ASPIRe:
The paper proposes an adaptive particle filter tree approach with sigma point-based mutual information reward approximation (ASPIRe). The main components are:

1) Sigma point-based approximation for mutual information: A novel method to accurately and efficiently estimate the mutual information between beliefs and future measurements for non-Gaussian distributions. It utilizes sigma points from belief particles to approximate entropy integrals.

2) Adaptive particle filter tree: A Monte Carlo tree search method that constructs an asymmetric tree with belief nodes. It features an adaptive criterion to automatically adjust tree depth for efficient planning. Information reward is used to guide tree expansion.

3) Combining 1) and 2) to enable abundant particles for accurate state inference, efficient non-myopic planning with continuous spaces, and real-time replanning.

Main Contributions:

- Accurate and efficientapproximation of mutual information for general belief distributions using sigma points 

- Adaptive particle filter tree approach for informative planning under sensing and motion uncertainties

- Demonstrated superior performance of ASPIRe over benchmarks in simulation and real-world experiments in terms of computational efficiency, search time, target visibility and localization accuracy

In summary, the paper develops a real-time informative planning approach ASPIRe that can effectively gather information and accurately estimate target state for mobile SAT problems. Both simulation and experimental results validate the advantages of ASPIRe.
