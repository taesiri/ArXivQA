# [Towards Enabling FAIR Dataspaces Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15451)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Dataspaces connected via semantics are gaining adoption to enable data sharing, including in less digitized domains like culture. This helps realize the FAIR principles. 
- However, the complexity of semantics and related technologies poses a barrier for dataspace adoption and increases costs for users.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose using Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to reduce complexity and costs by assisting users with tasks related to providing and consuming FAIR data via dataspaces.

Example Use Case Demonstrating Potential:
- The authors walk through an example focused on the cultural domain, using GPT-4 to extend a metadata schema, create an instance conforming to it, generate a usage policy and explain a created artifact.
- This shows LLMs can help with key tasks needed for FAIR data exchange. There were some minor issues in the LLM output, but the general applicability was demonstrated.

Proposed Research Agenda: 
- Interactive vs. automated systems using LLMs
- Techniques for adapting LLMs: prompt engineering and fine-tuning 
- Integrating knowledge graphs to address LLMs' limitations around correctness
- Using open models aligning with dataspaces' data sovereignty  
- Optimizing efficiency, latency and model size
- Ensuring safety of LLM-based systems

Main Contributions:
- First work analyzing the potential of LLMs to support adoption of FAIR dataspaces
- Practical example demonstrating applicability across key tasks
- Outline of research agenda for further exploration of this topic with guiding research questions

The paper makes an initial compelling case for how LLMs can aid FAIR data exchange via dataspaces and reduce complexity barriers if applied carefully. Many open questions remain around optimal techniques and safety considerations.
