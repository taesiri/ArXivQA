# [Generative Diffusion Prior for Unified Image Restoration and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01247)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is:Can diffusion models priors be used in a wide variety of image restoration tasks, including non-linear and blind inverse problems? The authors propose a method called Generative Diffusion Prior (GDP) to show that diffusion models can be effective for general-purpose image restoration. Specifically, the main hypotheses are:1. A well-trained denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) can serve as an effective prior for solving linear, non-linear and blind image restoration problems. 2. Systematically exploring conditional guidance protocols and adding guidance on a predicted clean image rather than the noisy image can improve sample quality.3. GDP can optimize degradation model parameters during diffusion model sampling to achieve blind image restoration where the degradation process is unknown.4. GDP can be extended to recover arbitrary size images via hierarchical guidance and patch-based methods.The authors demonstrate GDP's effectiveness empirically by showing it can outperform other methods on diverse linear inverse problems, low-light image enhancement, and HDR recovery using a single DDPM model. The main conclusion is diffusion models show promise as general purpose priors for image restoration.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes Generative Diffusion Prior (GDP), an unsupervised approach that uses a single pre-trained denoising diffusion generative model (DDPM) to solve a variety of image restoration and enhancement tasks including linear inverse problems, non-linear problems, and blind problems. 2. GDP is capable of optimizing randomly initialized degradation model parameters during the denoising process, allowing it to handle blind image restoration.3. The paper systematically investigates an effective way to guide the diffusion model sampling process, finding that guiding on the predicted clean image $\tilde{x}_0$ works better than guiding on the noisy image $x_t$.4. To enable arbitrary size image generation, the paper proposes hierarchical guidance and patch-based methods.5. The paper demonstrates GDP's effectiveness on tasks like super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, colorization, low-light enhancement, and HDR recovery, outperforming other unsupervised methods without any task-specific tuning. It also shows GDP can generalize to out-of-distribution natural images.In summary, the key contribution is proposing GDP as an efficient unsupervised approach for unified high-quality image restoration using a single pre-trained generative model, with innovations like blind restoration, effective guidance, and arbitrary size image handling.
