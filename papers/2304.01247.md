# [Generative Diffusion Prior for Unified Image Restoration and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01247)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is:

Can diffusion models priors be used in a wide variety of image restoration tasks, including non-linear and blind inverse problems? 

The authors propose a method called Generative Diffusion Prior (GDP) to show that diffusion models can be effective for general-purpose image restoration. Specifically, the main hypotheses are:

1. A well-trained denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) can serve as an effective prior for solving linear, non-linear and blind image restoration problems. 

2. Systematically exploring conditional guidance protocols and adding guidance on a predicted clean image rather than the noisy image can improve sample quality.

3. GDP can optimize degradation model parameters during diffusion model sampling to achieve blind image restoration where the degradation process is unknown.

4. GDP can be extended to recover arbitrary size images via hierarchical guidance and patch-based methods.

The authors demonstrate GDP's effectiveness empirically by showing it can outperform other methods on diverse linear inverse problems, low-light image enhancement, and HDR recovery using a single DDPM model. The main conclusion is diffusion models show promise as general purpose priors for image restoration.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes Generative Diffusion Prior (GDP), an unsupervised approach that uses a single pre-trained denoising diffusion generative model (DDPM) to solve a variety of image restoration and enhancement tasks including linear inverse problems, non-linear problems, and blind problems. 

2. GDP is capable of optimizing randomly initialized degradation model parameters during the denoising process, allowing it to handle blind image restoration.

3. The paper systematically investigates an effective way to guide the diffusion model sampling process, finding that guiding on the predicted clean image $\tilde{x}_0$ works better than guiding on the noisy image $x_t$.

4. To enable arbitrary size image generation, the paper proposes hierarchical guidance and patch-based methods.

5. The paper demonstrates GDP's effectiveness on tasks like super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, colorization, low-light enhancement, and HDR recovery, outperforming other unsupervised methods without any task-specific tuning.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a Generative Diffusion Prior (GDP) method that leverages a pretrained denoising diffusion probabilistic model for unified and unsupervised image restoration across various tasks like super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, colorization, low-light enhancement, and HDR recovery.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this CVPR 2023 paper compares to other research in image restoration and generative modeling:

- The key contribution is proposing GDP, a method that leverages diffusion models for general-purpose image restoration. This takes advantage of recent advances in generative modeling using diffusion probabilistic models. The paper shows that a single model trained on ImageNet can be effectively applied to tasks like super-resolution, inpainting, deblurring etc. without any task-specific training.

- Most prior work on image restoration uses supervised learning, where models are trained specifically for each degradation type. While effective, these lack flexibility. Some recent works have explored unsupervised image restoration, but are limited to simpler degradations. GDP advances unsupervised restoration to more complex blind degradations.

- The idea of using pre-trained generative models for image restoration has been explored before via GAN inversion, but most works use GANs. Leveraging diffusion models is relatively new. The paper shows DDPMs can be competitive or better than GANs as a image prior for restoration.

- For non-blind restoration, GDP relies on optimizing an explicit degradation model within the diffusion sampling loop. This degradation parameter optimization strategy is simple but effective for non-linear restoration.

- For large images, the proposed hierarchical patch-based strategy is intuitive. Similar ideas have been used in prior GAN inversion works. 

- The experiments are quite extensive, covering a wide range of degradation types. Comparisons to recent unsupervised methods like DGP, SNIPS, DDRM validate the advantages of GDP quantitatively and qualitatively.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in advancing unsupervised restoration by effectively utilizing the power of diffusion models as image priors. The approach is flexible, performs well across tasks, and advances the state of the art in blind image restoration.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some key future research directions suggested in the paper:

- Accelerating diffusion sampling techniques to improve inference time, which currently limits real-time application and deployment on weak devices. 

- Further studying how to automatically determine optimal guidance scales for different data distributions, instead of manual selection. The authors suggest guidance scales may be similar for the same data distribution and approximate degradation model.

- Extending GDP for 3D data restoration, such as point cloud completion and upsampling. Since these can be posed as linear inverse problems, GDP may be applicable.

- Applying GDP for recovery of degraded LiDAR point clouds under various real-world conditions, which introduces non-linear distortions. 

- Developing self-supervised training techniques inspired by GDP's framework, to further improve performance of unsupervised image restoration models.

In summary, the main future directions are: accelerating inference, automating hyperparameter selection, extending to 3D tasks, handling real-world LiDAR degradation, and incorporating insights from GDP into self-supervised training. The authors suggest a range of promising research avenues to build upon the proposed GDP framework.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a Generative Diffusion Prior (GDP) method for unified image restoration and enhancement. GDP utilizes a pre-trained denoising diffusion generative model (DDPM) to effectively model the posterior distribution for solving linear inverse, non-linear, and blind image restoration problems in an unsupervised sampling manner. Two variants of GDP are introduced - GDP-x_t which adds guidance on the noisy image x_t in each timestep, and GDP-x_0 which predicts a clean image x_0 from x_t and adds guidance on x_0. For blind problems like low-light enhancement and HDR recovery, GDP can optimize randomly initialized degradation model parameters during the diffusion process. GDP also uses hierarchical guidance and patch-based methods to handle images of arbitrary sizes. Experiments demonstrate GDP's effectiveness on linear inverse problems like super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting and colorization as well as non-linear/blind problems like low-light enhancement and HDR recovery, outperforming other unsupervised methods while using just a single DDPM model pretrained on ImageNet. GDP generalizes well to natural images outside of ImageNet.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Generative Diffusion Prior (GDP) for unified image restoration and enhancement. Image restoration aims to reconstruct a high-quality image from a degraded image, while enhancement improves image quality. Existing methods either require supervised training for each task or are inefficient. GDP utilizes a pre-trained denoising diffusion generative model (DDPM) as an effective prior for solving linear inverse, non-linear, and blind image restoration problems without task-specific training. 

GDP systematically explores conditional guidance techniques and finds adding guidance to the predicted clean image is better than the noisy image. It can optimize unknown degradation parameters during diffusion, enabling blind restoration. GDP uses hierarchical guidance and patches for arbitrary image sizes. Experiments show GDP achieves state-of-the-art results on linear inverse problems like super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, and colorization on ImageNet. It also succeeds on non-linear problems like low-light enhancement and HDR recovery, outperforming existing unsupervised methods. Overall, GDP provides an efficient unsupervised framework for diverse image restoration tasks using just a single DDPM model pre-trained on ImageNet.

Furthermore, GDP proposes hierarchical guidance and patch-based generation strategies to enable handling of arbitrary image sizes. The method is evaluated on ImageNet and specialized datasets for both linear and non-linear tasks, outperforming prior unsupervised approaches.
