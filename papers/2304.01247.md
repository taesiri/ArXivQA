# [Generative Diffusion Prior for Unified Image Restoration and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01247)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is:Can diffusion models priors be used in a wide variety of image restoration tasks, including non-linear and blind inverse problems? The authors propose a method called Generative Diffusion Prior (GDP) to show that diffusion models can be effective for general-purpose image restoration. Specifically, the main hypotheses are:1. A well-trained denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) can serve as an effective prior for solving linear, non-linear and blind image restoration problems. 2. Systematically exploring conditional guidance protocols and adding guidance on a predicted clean image rather than the noisy image can improve sample quality.3. GDP can optimize degradation model parameters during diffusion model sampling to achieve blind image restoration where the degradation process is unknown.4. GDP can be extended to recover arbitrary size images via hierarchical guidance and patch-based methods.The authors demonstrate GDP's effectiveness empirically by showing it can outperform other methods on diverse linear inverse problems, low-light image enhancement, and HDR recovery using a single DDPM model. The main conclusion is diffusion models show promise as general purpose priors for image restoration.
