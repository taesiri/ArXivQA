# [Select High-Level Features: Efficient Experts from a Hierarchical   Classification Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05601)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Larger deep learning models and more training data lead to better performance, but also higher computational requirements, making deployment on resource-constrained edge devices difficult. 
- Existing efficiency methods like pruning and quantization can compromise performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a hierarchical classification network topology that allows nesting of high-level features and parallel processing. 
- Use a language model to estimate similarity between categories and construct feature hierarchy.
- Propose an innovative expert extraction technique to select only the task-relevant high-level features at inference time.

Key Contributions:
- Novel network topology combining sequential low-level feature processing with parallelism and nesting of high-level features, enabled by removing fully connected layers.  
- New method to generate efficient experts that can skip unnecessary high-level computations based on task needs, without retraining.
- Evaluation shows expert with 5 out of 1000 categories matches accuracy of larger model, while reducing parameters by 88.7% and computations by 73.4%.
- Overall, experts reduce average parameters by 47.6% and computations by 5.8% with same or better accuracy over baselines.
- Demonstrates adaptability to task complexity without compromising performance, suitable for edge devices to large-scale cloud systems.

In summary, the key innovation is the ability to dynamically configure high-level features based on task categories, enabling lightweight yet accurate experts specialized to application needs. This provides efficiency and flexibility while maintaining predictive performance across diverse hardware.
