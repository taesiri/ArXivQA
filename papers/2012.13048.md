# [ProofWriter: Generating Implications, Proofs, and Abductive Statements   over Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13048)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question of this paper is: 

How can we enable neural networks to systematically generate natural language proofs, implications, and abductive inferences for logical reasoning?

Specifically, the paper aims to show that generative transformer models can reliably:

1) Generate natural language proofs to explain the reasoning behind an answer to a question, given a set of facts and rules. 

2) Generate logical implications that follow from a set of facts and rules.

3) Perform abductive inference to identify missing facts that would allow an unprovable conclusion to be proved.

The overall goal is to significantly improve the viability of neural methods for logical reasoning directly over natural language by equipping them with capabilities beyond just assigning true/false labels. The paper presents a system called ProofWriter that demonstrates these capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A new method for generating natural language proofs to explain the reasoning behind an answer to a question, given a set of facts and rules expressed in natural language. The method obtains state-of-the-art results on the RuleTaker benchmark datasets.

2. A technique for generating logical implications that follow from statements expressed in natural language (implication enumeration). This allows enumerating consequences of a theory, rather than just assigning truth values to hypotheses.

3. A method for performing a constrained form of abduction over natural language theories. Given an unprovable conclusion, the method can identify a missing fact that would allow the conclusion to be proved when added to the theory.

4. New datasets to promote further research in natural language reasoning and inference tasks like proof generation, implication enumeration, and abduction.

In summary, the key contribution is developing generative neural methods to produce proofs, implications, and abductive statements from natural language theories. This significantly advances the capabilities of neural models to perform systematic logical reasoning over language.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses specifically on generating implications, proofs, and abductive statements directly from natural language theories. Much prior work has focused on logical reasoning and theorem proving using formal logic representations rather than natural language. This work shows that transformers can perform systematic reasoning directly over natural language without needing a formal representation.

- For proof generation, this paper introduces a new iterative proof generation method that outperforms prior work like PRover. PRover used a combination of classification and ILP to assemble proofs, whereas this work shows strong results can be achieved by iteratively generating 1-step proofs then assembling them. The iterative approach also gives more faithful proofs.

- This is the first paper to explore abduction (identifying missing facts to prove a conclusion) over natural language theories using neural models. It provides a new dataset and strong baseline for this task. Prior work on abduction has focused on logical and classical AI methods.

- For implication enumeration, this paper compares generating all implications in one shot versus iteratively generating them. The iterative approach works better, especially for out-of-domain theories.

- The iterative proof generation method illustrates how transformers can be used in a "scale invariant" way, where performance stays robust even as the reasoning depth increases. This is an interesting architectural insight.

- The work introduces several new datasets to promote research in this area, including abductive variants of existing rule reasoning datasets.

Overall, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in neural logical reasoning over language, providing new methods, insights, and resources to study systematic reasoning and explanation generation. The results significantly improve the viability of using neural methods for logical reasoning in practical applications.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several potential future research directions:

- Refining the iterative approach to be more efficient and guided, rather than exhaustive forward-chaining. They suggest using techniques like best-first expansion or backward-chaining. 

- Handling larger theories that exceed the transformer's input length limit, potentially by adding a retrieval mechanism.

- Expanding the abductive capability beyond single facts, using an iterative approach analogous to Iterative ProofWriter. This could help unlock reasoning with more implicit knowledge.

- Testing the methods on more varied and complex language, and adapting as needed. The current datasets use somewhat templated language.

- Exploring how these deductive capabilities could be integrated into more comprehensive language models like GPT-3.

- Continuing to build additional datasets to promote research in this area.

In summary, some key future directions are improving scalability, integrating abductive/deductive reasoning with broader language models, testing the robustness to more varied language, and expanding abduction to handle more complex missing knowledge. The authors have demonstrated promising capabilities but note there is significant room for improvement.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents ProofWriter, a system that can generate natural language proofs to explain the reasoning behind answers to questions, given a knowledge base of facts and rules expressed in natural language. ProofWriter demonstrates three main capabilities: proof generation, implication enumeration, and abduction. For proof generation, it compares two approaches - generating the full proof "all-at-once" versus iteratively generating and chaining 1-step proofs. The iterative approach is shown to generalize better to longer proofs than seen during training. For implication enumeration, ProofWriter can generate all the logical implications of a given theory, with the iterative approach again outperforming the all-at-once strategy. For abduction, given an unprovable conclusion, ProofWriter can suggest additional facts that could be added to make the conclusion provable. Experiments across RuleTaker datasets of natural language reasoning problems show state-of-the-art results on proof generation and strong baselines on the other tasks. Overall, ProofWriter significantly advances the ability of AI systems to explain their reasoning over knowledge expressed in natural language.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper proposes a new system called ProofWriter for generating logical implications, proofs, and abductive statements from natural language rules and facts. ProofWriter uses generative transformer models fine-tuned on reasoning datasets to produce proofs and implications in an iterative, step-by-step manner. This results in highly reliable proofs that generalize well and represent the model's actual reasoning process. On the RuleTaker benchmark, ProofWriter achieves state-of-the-art results for proof generation, improving accuracy by 9% absolute over prior work. ProofWriter also demonstrates strong capability for implication enumeration and abductive reasoning. 

Paragraph 2: ProofWriter consists of iterative and non-iterative versions. The iterative model repeatedly generates 1-step implications which are chained together into full proofs. This approach generalizes better than non-iterative models to unseen proof depths. ProofWriter also introduces a constrained form of abduction, where given a theory and unprovable conclusion, the system identifies a missing fact that would allow proving the conclusion. Across reasoning datasets including RuleTaker, ParaRules, and Birds-Electricity, ProofWriter shows robust performance, producing interpretable, faithful proofs. The work significantly advances the viability of neural methods for systematic reasoning over language.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a new system called ProofWriter for generating natural language proofs to explain the results of logical reasoning over natural language theories. The main method is an iterative approach where a model is first trained to generate single-step (depth 1) implications of a theory along with their 1-step proofs. At test time, this model is applied repeatedly to iteratively expand the theory with new implications and assemble their 1-step proof fragments into full multi-step proofs. Specifically, the model takes as input a theory (facts and rules in natural language) and generates a new 1-step implication that follows from the theory along with a 1-step proof fragment. This new implication is added to the theory and the process repeats to expand the theory until no more implications can be generated. The 1-step proof fragments can then be assembled into full proofs for any query against the original theory. This iterative approach is shown to be more robust than an "all-at-once" approach that tries to generate the entire proof in one shot. The iterative method produces proofs that accurately reflect the model's step-by-step inferences.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problems/questions it is addressing are:

1. How can we get neural networks/transformers to not just assign true/false labels to logical implications over natural language theories, but actually generate the implications and proofs of those implications? 

2. How can we get transformers to generate proofs that accurately reflect the model's actual reasoning steps, rather than just being post-hoc rationalizations?

3. Can transformers perform logical abduction - identifying missing facts needed to prove an implication - over natural language theories?

4. Can transformers generate arbitrary depth proofs over natural language theories, even for depths not seen during training? 

5. How do different proof generation strategies - like "All-At-Once" versus "Iterative" - compare in terms of accuracy and generalization?

In summary, the key problems are getting transformers to generate logical implications, proofs, and abductive statements over natural language theories, ensuring the proofs faithfully reflect the model's reasoning, and generalizing to unseen proof depths. The paper explores different techniques for addressing these challenges.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper presents ProofWriter, a generative model that can reliably generate implications, proofs, and abductive statements over natural language theories. The key innovation is using a 1-step implication generator iteratively to build multi-hop proofs. This iterative approach assembles proofs from 1-hop fragments and is shown to exceed prior methods, achieving 96.2% proof accuracy on the RuleTaker dataset compared to 87.1% for the previous state-of-the-art. Critically, ProofWriter's proofs reflect actual model decisions rather than post-hoc rationalizations. Beyond proof generation, ProofWriter can also reliably enumerate logical implications of a theory and perform a constrained form of abduction, identifying missing facts that would allow an unprovable conclusion to be proved. Together, these capabilities significantly advance neural methods for systematic reasoning over language. The iterative approach is shown to generalize well, including to longer proof depths and more varied language than seen during training. The work concludes by discussing how ProofWriter could leverage both explicit and implicit knowledge, using abduction to materialize the implicit knowledge needed to generate complete proofs. Overall, ProofWriter substantially improves the viability of neural methods for formal reasoning over natural language.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a new system called ProofWriter for automated reasoning and proof generation over rules and facts expressed in natural language. ProofWriter can generate proofs to answer questions, enumerate all valid logical implications of a theory, and perform a restricted form of abductive reasoning to identify missing facts that would allow an unprovable conclusion to be proved. It is built on top of a T5 transformer model fine-tuned for these reasoning tasks. ProofWriter substantially exceeds prior work on proof generation, with a 9% absolute improvement in accuracy over the previous state-of-the-art. It can generate proofs in two ways: all at once given the full context and question, or iteratively by chaining together 1-step proofs until the answer is found. The iterative approach generalizes much better to proof depths beyond those seen during training. ProofWriter also demonstrates strong capabilities at implication enumeration and abductive inference. Together, this significantly advances the viability of neural networks for emulating reasoning and inference directly over natural language. The code and datasets are publicly released to promote further research.
