# [MoqaGPT : Zero-Shot Multi-modal Open-domain Question Answering with   Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13265)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces MoqaGPT, a novel framework that enables large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to tackle multi-modal open-domain question answering (MMOQA) in a zero-shot manner. The core idea is to use a divide-and-conquer approach where candidate answers are first extracted independently from text, image, and table references using frozen models. A rule-based strategy then filters out invalid responses. Finally, the LLM fuses the multi-modal information and selects the most plausible answer through reasoning. This approach provides flexibility to accommodate new models and modalities, trustworthiness by grounding answers in retrieved results, and interpretability via natural language outputs. Experiments on two MMOQA datasets - MMCoQA and MultiModalQA - demonstrate the efficacy of MoqaGPT. It surpasses supervised baselines on MMCoQA by over 30 F1 points, benefiting from superior retrieval. On MultiModalQA, it outperforms zero-shot baselines by 9.5 F1 points despite no training, showcasing the reasoning capability of LLMs. Ablations validate the contribution of each component. By enabling LLMs to leverage multi-modal inputs for reasoning, MoqaGPT provides an effective foundation for interpretable and reliable open-domain QA.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes MoqaGPT, a flexible and interpretable framework that enables large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to perform multi-modal open-domain question answering (MMOQA) in a zero-shot manner. MoqaGPT employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to retrieve references from text, image, and table databases independently using robust models like CLIP, Ada, and ANCE. It then extracts answers from each modality separately using vision-language models for images and LLMs for text/tables. A rule-based strategy filters out invalid responses. Finally, MoqaGPT leverages LLMs as a reasoning mechanism to integrate the multi-modal information and select the most plausible answer. Experiments on MMCoQA and MultiModalQA datasets show MoqaGPT significantly improves over supervised baselines and closed the gap with state-of-the-art methods. The framework is flexible to accommodate new models/modalities, more trustworthy by grounding responses on retrieved results, and interpretable thanks to the transparent reasoning process.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to enable large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to solve multi-modal open-domain question answering (MMOQA) tasks in a zero-shot manner, without requiring task-specific training data. 

The key hypothesis is that LLMs can effectively tackle MMOQA tasks if paired with a modular "divide-and-conquer" framework that:

1) Retrieves candidate evidence from multi-modal sources (text, tables, images) independently using robust models like CLIP, ANCE, etc.

2) Extracts candidate answers from the retrieved evidence separately per modality using frozen models like VLMs and LLMs.

3) Reasons about the candidate answers using LLMs and selects the most appropriate final answer in a zero-shot setting. 

The paper introduces MoqaGPT, an implementation of this hypothesis, and shows experimentally that it enables LLMs like GPT-4 to address MMOQA better than base LLMs and competitively with supervised methods, validating the core hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing MoqaGPT, a novel framework that enables large language models (LLMs) like GPT to tackle multi-modal open-domain question answering (MMOQA) in a zero-shot manner. The key highlights are:

- MoqaGPT uses a divide-and-conquer approach to retrieve and extract answers from different modalities like text, tables, and images independently. This provides flexibility to incorporate new models and modalities easily.

- It then leverages LLMs as a reasoning mechanism to integrate the multi-modal information and generate the final answer. This makes the system more interpretable and reduces the risk of hallucination compared to directly querying LLMs.

- The framework operates in a zero-shot setting without requiring any task-specific training. Experiments on MMCoQA and MultiModalQA datasets show it boosts performance over supervised baselines and direct QA methods.

- Overall, MoqaGPT offers a simple yet effective approach to equip LLMs with multi-modal reasoning capabilities in a zero-shot manner for MMOQA. The results validate the promise of this modular framework.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review of the paper, here are some key ways this work compares to other research in multi-modal open-domain question answering:

- It proposes the first zero-shot framework (MoqaGPT) for enabling large language models like GPT to tackle this task. Other existing methods typically require training either joint multimodal encoders or separate question classifiers/QA models per modality.

- The modular divide-and-conquer approach provides flexibility to incorporate new models and modalities without retraining, unlike joint embedding methods that need full retraining.

- It aims to enhance trustworthiness and interpretability by grounding answers in retrieved results and providing transparent reasoning. Many models are prone to hallucination without grounding.

- Experiments show it boosts performance on MMCoQA over supervised baselines by +37.91 F1 and +34.07 EM points. On MultiModalQA it surpasses zero-shot baselines and narrows the gap to supervised methods.

- Ablations demonstrate the efficacy of the rule-based strategy for denoising and the Chain-of-Thought prompting for improving answer extraction. 

Overall, the work presents a novel framework that differs from existing approaches and demonstrates strong zero-shot capabilities. The modular nature and transparent outputs are notable advantages over other models. However, reliance on LLMs can incur cost and reproducibility challenges.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Testing the framework on larger multi-modal open-domain QA datasets like WebQA to further assess its effectiveness for retrieval from vast knowledge bases.

- Exploring different prompt design strategies to optimize the performance of the various modules like retrieval, QA, and reasoning.

- Evaluating the framework's capabilities on conversational QA tasks where context and history are important.

- Examining if chain-of-thought prompting can be effectively incorporated to improve reasoning and performance.

- Experimenting with more advanced models as they become available to further validate the flexibility of the modular framework. For instance, testing with models like PaLM, Gopher or BLOOM.

- Assessing the framework on multilingual datasets to determine cross-lingual effectiveness.

- Exploring learning-based approaches within the modules while retaining overall zero-shot operation.

- Developing techniques to further improve interpretability, traceability and error analysis.

In summary, the authors propose enhancements like testing on more complex datasets, integrating latest models, improving reasoning, and boosting interpretability as promising future work to build on their proposed MoqaGPT framework.
