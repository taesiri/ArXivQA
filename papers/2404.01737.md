# [Transfer Learning from Whisper for Microscopic Intelligibility   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01737)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper focuses on microscopic intelligibility prediction, which aims to model human speech perception at a finer level than traditional macroscopic models. Specifically, the paper tackles the challenging problem of predicting listeners' lexical (word-level) responses to noisy speech stimuli.

Method:
- The authors propose using transfer learning from Whisper, a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model trained on 680,000 hours of diverse speech data. 
- They apply Whisper in a zero-shot fashion to directly predict distributions over lexical responses.
- They also fine-tune separate components of Whisper (decoder, encoder transformer, encoder CNN) to match human responses.

Results:
- Their method significantly outperforms all baseline models in terms of likelihood and correlation with human responses.
- Fine-tuning, especially of the encoder CNN, yields large gains over zero-shot transfer, suggesting Whisper does not fully capture acoustic information relevant for human perception.  
- Performance scales with model size, with the largest Whisper variant achieving the best results.
- Modeling the full distribution of responses works better than just predicting the majority response.

Overall, the paper demonstrates the promise of transfer learning from large-scale ASR models for microscopic speech intelligibility prediction. Fine-tuning on human responses yields better modeling of speech perception phenomena than direct zero-shot application.
