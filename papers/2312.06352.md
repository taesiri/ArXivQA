# [NuScenes-MQA: Integrated Evaluation of Captions and QA for Autonomous   Driving Datasets using Markup Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06352)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a new dataset called NuScenes-MQA for training and evaluating vision language models, especially for autonomous driving applications. The key innovation is the use of "Markup-QA", where QA segments are enclosed within textual markups, allowing the simultaneous evaluation of both natural language generation quality and QA accuracy. The authors constructed the dataset by systematically generating captions and questions about object presence, counts, distances etc. based on the NuScenes driving dataset. The dataset contains over 1.4 million annotated samples covering various types of queries about driving scenes. Experiments demonstrate strengths and weaknesses of different model architectures on this dataset. Key results show that using markups as special tokens improves QA accuracy but can hurt caption quality. Challenging areas like handling multiple QA in one sentence are identified. The dataset enables developing vision language models that are proficient in both description and precise question answering for autonomous driving.
