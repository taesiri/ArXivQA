# [A Neural Tangent Kernel Perspective of GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05566v5)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper addresses the following central research questions:

1. How can we develop an accurate theoretical framework to analyze generative adversarial networks (GANs) that properly models the alternating optimization procedure used in practice? 

2. How does modeling the discriminator architecture and inductive biases via neural tangent kernels affect our understanding of GAN training dynamics and convergence?

3. What is the true loss function and gradient field implicitly optimized by the generator under this framework, and how does it differ from standard GAN theory?

4. Can this framework help explain and reconcile some of the discrepancies between GAN theory and empirical results, such as vanilla GANs appearing to work well in practice despite theoretical claims that they should fail?

5. What novel theoretical insights can be gained about different GAN losses and architectures by analyzing them through the lens of this framework?

The key hypothesis is that properly accounting for the neural network parameterization of the discriminator and the alternating optimization procedure will lead to a more accurate theoretical modeling of GAN training. This in turn will provide new insights into the convergence and dynamics of GANs compared to prior work that does not capture these aspects. The framework aims to address theoretical shortcomings in existing GAN analyses and align theory closer to practice.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel GAN modeling approach via neural tangent kernels to address limitations in prior theory, derive new results and insights, and better explain empirical GAN behaviors. The key hypothesis is that this framework will more accurately capture the realities of GAN training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a new theoretical framework for analyzing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs). The key ideas are:

- Leveraging NTK theory to model the discriminator in GAN training, instead of treating it as an arbitrary function like in previous analyses. This allows properly taking into account the inductive biases of neural network architectures.

- Using this NTK modeling to prove new results about the differentiability and regularity of the discriminator, resolving issues with ill-defined gradients in prior GAN theory.

- Deriving the dynamics and gradient flow of the generated distribution during training based on the generator's NTK. This reveals new insights about the loss implicitly optimized by the generator. 

- Discovering in particular that GANs with Integral Probability Metric losses optimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy of the discriminator's NTK between the generated and target distributions.

- Releasing an analysis toolkit to empirically validate the theoretical modeling and provide new experimental insights, e.g. about the benefits of ReLU activations compared to kernels like RBF.

In summary, this work introduces the first principled NTK-based modeling and analysis of GAN training and architecture, addressing fundamental limitations of previous GAN theory and leading to novel theoretical and empirical results and perspectives. The proposed framework and toolkit enable more accurate GAN understanding and open up new research directions.
