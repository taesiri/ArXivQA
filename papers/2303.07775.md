# [Data-Free Sketch-Based Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07775)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we perform sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) in a data-free setting without using any real photo-sketch pairs for training? 

The key points are:

- SBIR typically requires training on paired photos and sketches, which is expensive and difficult to obtain in large quantities. 

- The paper proposes a novel "data-free" SBIR approach that does not use any real training data. Instead, it leverages knowledge from pre-trained photo and sketch classifiers.

- The core technical contribution is a method called CrossX-DFL that allows "data-free learning across modalities and metric spaces." It transfers knowledge from the classifiers (teachers) to learn unified photo-sketch encoders (students) without needing real training data.

- Experiments show their method achieves competitive performance to supervised SBIR approaches on standard datasets, despite using no real training data.

In summary, the key research question is how to do SBIR without real paired training data by transferring knowledge from pre-trained classifiers in a cross-modal distillation process. The proposed CrossX-DFL method aims to address this question.
