## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this survey paper on prompt engineering for vision-language models compares to other research in the field:- Scope: This paper provides a comprehensive overview focused specifically on prompt engineering techniques for pre-trained vision-language models. Other surveys tend to cover prompt engineering more broadly across NLP, computer vision, and multimodal models. The specificity on VLMs sets this paper apart.- Structure: The paper systematically examines prompt engineering approaches for three main types of VLMs - multimodal-to-text, image-text matching, and text-to-image models. This structure provides clarity on prompting methods tailored to different VLM architectures. - Novelty: The survey highlights the latest advancements in prompting techniques like chain-of-thought and retrieval-based prompting for VLMs. It also covers recent models not extensively discussed before like Flamingo, CLIP, and Stable Diffusion.- Applications: The survey not only covers prompting techniques but also their applications across tasks like VQA, captioning, classification, etc. This provides insights into the utility of prompting in real-world scenarios.- Responsible AI: The analysis of ethical considerations around robustness, bias, fairness, privacy etc. for prompt engineering on VLMs is quite comprehensive. This is an important dimension not extensively addressed in prior surveys.- Limitations: As acknowledged by the authors, the rapidly evolving nature of this field makes it hard to provide an exhaustive review. The focus is primarily on transformer-based VLMs, not covering other architectures.Overall, this survey provides a timely, comprehensive and structured overview of prompt engineering for VLMs specifically. The coverage of techniques, models, applications and ethical issues offers unique value compared to prior works. While scope for extension remains, it significantly advances understanding of this emerging field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions the authors suggest:- Incorporating other modalities beyond visual and textual, such as audio and thermal, into multimodal-to-text models. The authors highlight the need to address the heterogeneity in data formats, scales, and structures across modalities.- Exploring prompt tuning techniques for popular generative multimodal-to-text models, as most existing research has focused on hard prompts. Soft prompts based on image-text matching models have been more widely studied.- Investigating the underlying mechanisms of how multimodal-to-text models learn from demonstration prompts and the specific contributions of different aspects of the demonstrations. This could help refine and optimize the performance of these models.- Studying the application of visual prompts in image-text matching models, especially for adapting to difficult scenarios like dense objects, object hallucination, and modern VLMs. Understanding the role and impact of visual prompts is key.- Examining how unified prompting that combines both visual and textual prompts can enhance the performance of image-text matching models in both branches.- Addressing challenges in extending text-to-image generation to video and 3D scenarios, like inconsistency of input control maps propagating errors. Incorporating visual prompting could help.- Exploring methods like reinforcement learning from human feedback and constitutional AI for harmlessness in multimodal models.- Improving in-context learning capacity in multimodal models.- Considering integrity issues like bias, privacy, transparency, and robustness when adapting models via prompting.- Studying the relationship between prompts on different types of VLMs and their interaction with model architectures.The authors highlight prompt engineering as an important area for advancing vision-language research and suggest many promising directions, from incorporating new modalities to improving integrity, that can be explored in future work.
