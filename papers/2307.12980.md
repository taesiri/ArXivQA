# [A Systematic Survey of Prompt Engineering on Vision-Language Foundation   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12980)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main goal is to provide a comprehensive survey and analysis of the current research on prompt engineering techniques for pre-trained vision-language models. The key research questions and focus areas appear to be:- What are the different types of vision-language models and how can prompt engineering be applied to them? The main model types studied are multimodal-to-text generation models, image-text matching models, and text-to-image generation models.- What are the different prompting methods that have been proposed and how do they work? The paper categorizes prompting methods into hard prompts (natural language instructions) and soft prompts (learnable vector representations).- What are some example applications where prompting vision-language models has shown benefits? The paper highlights applications in areas like visual question answering, image captioning, chatbots, etc.- What are the main trends and findings around understanding prompting techniques? Factors like prompt semantics, diversity, and controllability are discussed.- What are some of the key challenges and future opportunities around responsible AI and ethics when applying prompting techniques? Issues like bias, robustness, transparency, privacy are summarized.In summary, the central focus seems to be providing a structured taxonomy and review of prompt engineering research specifically for pre-trained vision-language models, summarizing the current progress, applications, and analyses to identify challenges and opportunities moving forward. The paper aims to serve as a reference guide and resource for future research on prompting techniques for vision-language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is providing a comprehensive survey and overview of the recent progress in prompt engineering techniques for pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically:- The paper categorizes and reviews different prompting methods, including hard prompts (task instructions, in-context learning, retrieval-based prompting, chain-of-thought prompting) and soft prompts (prompt tuning, prefix token tuning).- It surveys the application of these prompting techniques on three main types of vision-language models: multimodal-to-text generation models, image-text matching models, and text-to-image generation models. For each model type, the prompting methods, applications, and responsible AI considerations are discussed.- The relationship between prompting vision-language models versus prompting unimodal language or vision models is analyzed. The analogies and differences are highlighted. - Challenges, future directions, and opportunities for future research on prompting vision-language models are summarized, covering topics like incorporating new modalities, visual prompting, generalization of prompting techniques, and responsible AI issues.In summary, this paper provides a structured taxonomy and comprehensive overview of the quickly evolving field of prompt engineering on vision-language models. The systematic categorization of methods and models, along with the insightful discussion of relationships, applications, and responsible AI considerations, represents the key contribution and value of this survey paper. It offers a valuable reference for researchers looking to further advance prompt engineering techniques for vision-language models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current research on prompt engineering techniques for adapting pre-trained vision-language models to new tasks, covering prompting methods, applications, and responsible AI considerations across three main types of models - multimodal-to-text, image-text matching, and text-to-image generation models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this survey paper on prompt engineering for vision-language models compares to other research in the field:- Scope: This paper provides a comprehensive overview focused specifically on prompt engineering techniques for pre-trained vision-language models. Other surveys tend to cover prompt engineering more broadly across NLP, computer vision, and multimodal models. The specificity on VLMs sets this paper apart.- Structure: The paper systematically examines prompt engineering approaches for three main types of VLMs - multimodal-to-text, image-text matching, and text-to-image models. This structure provides clarity on prompting methods tailored to different VLM architectures. - Novelty: The survey highlights the latest advancements in prompting techniques like chain-of-thought and retrieval-based prompting for VLMs. It also covers recent models not extensively discussed before like Flamingo, CLIP, and Stable Diffusion.- Applications: The survey not only covers prompting techniques but also their applications across tasks like VQA, captioning, classification, etc. This provides insights into the utility of prompting in real-world scenarios.- Responsible AI: The analysis of ethical considerations around robustness, bias, fairness, privacy etc. for prompt engineering on VLMs is quite comprehensive. This is an important dimension not extensively addressed in prior surveys.- Limitations: As acknowledged by the authors, the rapidly evolving nature of this field makes it hard to provide an exhaustive review. The focus is primarily on transformer-based VLMs, not covering other architectures.Overall, this survey provides a timely, comprehensive and structured overview of prompt engineering for VLMs specifically. The coverage of techniques, models, applications and ethical issues offers unique value compared to prior works. While scope for extension remains, it significantly advances understanding of this emerging field.
