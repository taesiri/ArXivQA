# [Medical Image Registration and Its Application in Retinal Images: A   Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16502)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Medical image registration is vital for disease diagnosis and treatment by aligning images captured under different conditions to fuse information. Prior surveys have not systematically reviewed registration methodologies.
- Retinal image registration combining structural and functional retinal images is crucial but has attracted limited attention. No surveys have comprehensively reviewed retinal registration works.

Methods Reviewed:
- The paper reviews both traditional registration methods (intensity and feature-based) as well as recent deep learning methods (CNN, GAN, Transformer based).
- It discusses common transformations like rigid, affine, deformable, compares similarity metrics like MI, CC, etc. 
- For deep methods, it covers patch-based, end-to-end, cascade, consistency-based, deep similarity methods.

Retinal Registration Focus: 
- Reviewed intensity and feature-based retinal registration works utilizing retinal landmarks.  
- Discussed deep learning retinal registration papers using mainstream architectures and domain-specific approaches leveraging vessel segmentation.
- Identified challenges like lack of public datasets, deep learning works for linear registration, poor similarity metrics.

Key Contributions:
- First review systematically summarizing methodologies of existing medical image registration works, both traditional and deep learning based.
- Specifically focuses on reviewing retinal image registration progress and compares it with mainstream registration. 
- Analyzes advantages and limitations of different method categories.
- Discusses open challenges in retinal registration and provides insights into future scope.

In summary, this is a comprehensive review spanning fundamental concepts to state-of-the-art methods for medical image registration, with an emphasis on retinal image registration analysis and challenges.
