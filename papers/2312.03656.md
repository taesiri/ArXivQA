# [Interpretability Illusions in the Generalization of Simplified Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03656)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates whether common methods of simplifying deep learning models to make them more interpretable, such as dimensionality reduction and clustering, provide faithful approximations of the model's behavior out-of-distribution. The authors train Transformer language models on controlled datasets that allow systematic splits between train and test distributions, including variants of balanced parenthesis languages and a code completion task. They simplify representations within the models using techniques like PCA and clustering, construct corresponding simplified proxy models, and evaluate how well these proxies match the original models on in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets. Across tasks, they consistently find generalization gaps between the original Transformer and its simplified proxy, wherein the proxy underestimates the model's systematic generalization abilities. The simplifications seem to capture coarse model behavior but miss critical details that enable generalization. The results raise important questions around the common practice of using simplified model abstractions for interpretation, suggesting they may present illusion of understanding. More analysis is needed to fully characterize which model components lead to these generalization gaps and how simplification methods could better encapsulate model computations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper finds that simplified representations of neural network models, which are commonly used to interpret the models, often fail to faithfully characterize how the original models generalize to out-of-distribution data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is pointing out that simplified representations of deep learning models, which are commonly used to interpret how the models work, may not faithfully capture the models' behavior out-of-distribution. Specifically, the paper shows experiments with Transformer language models where simplifications like dimensionality reduction and clustering of attention embeddings result in "proxy" models that match the original fairly well on in-distribution data, but generalize worse on out-of-distribution systematic splits. This indicates there can be a generalization gap between the original complex model and simplified interpretations of it. The paper demonstrates this on controlled language modeling tasks like Dyck languages and code completion, and analyzes the differences in errors made by the original and simplified models. Overall, it raises important questions around the reliability of common model interpretation methods based on simplification when predicting model behavior on novel inputs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's abstract and contents, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Simplified model representations - The paper focuses on using tools like singular value decomposition (SVD) to create lower-dimensional approximations of models to interpret them.

- Generalization gaps - The paper illustrates cases where simplified model representations accurately capture the original model's behavior on the training distribution, but fail to generalize as well out-of-distribution. There are gaps between the original and simplified models.

- Transformer models - The paper trains and studies small Transformer language models on controlled datasets to illustrate its points about simplified representations.

- Dyck languages - One of the main controlled dataset used in the paper is the Dyck balanced parenthesis languages, which have hierarchical structure.

- Systematic generalization splits - The paper looks at model generalization to different kinds of distribution shifts like new structures, sequence lengths, and nesting depths in the Dyck languages.

- Dimensionality reduction - Tools like singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal components analysis (PCA) are used to reduce the dimensionality of the models' representations to simplify them. 

- Clustering - K-means clustering of the model representations is another simplification approach explored.

- One-hot attention - Replacing the softmax attention with one-hot attention to the top key is a way the paper simplifies the model itself in a data-agnostic way.

So in summary, the key ideas have to do with using simplified model proxies to understand the original models, and testing if they faithfully capture the model's generalization abilities out-of-distribution through systematic splits. The paper finds gaps between original and simplified model behaviors.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper argues that simplified model representations may not accurately capture a model's behavior out-of-distribution. Could you elaborate more on why this might happen even if the simplified representation provides a good approximation in-distribution? 

2. The paper focuses specifically on simplifying Transformer language models using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and clustering. Do you think similar issues could arise when trying to interpret other types of models (e.g. CNNs, RNNs) using other interpretability techniques?

3. The paper highlights the risk of developing "illusory" understanding of models by only analyzing their behavior in-distribution. What are some ways we could test or validate interpretations to avoid this? For example, what kinds of systematic distribution shifts would be most informative?

4. You find that data-dependent simplification methods, like PCA and clustering, lead to larger generalization gaps compared to the data-independent simplification method of using hard attention. Why do you think this occurs? What implications does this have?

5. You identify differences in how well the simplified proxy models are able to capture the original model's behavior on different subtasks within the code completion task. What intrinsic properties of a prediction task do you think determine the potential generalization gap?

6. The "induction head" attention pattern that emerges in the code completion experiments seems particularly difficult for the simplified models to capture out-of-distribution. What functionality does this attention pattern provide, and why might it be more sensitive to distribution shifts?  

7. The paper focuses on simplifying and interpreting individual components of Transformers. How difficult do you think it would be to scale up this type of analysis to identify and validate larger multi-component circuits? What challenges need to be overcome?

8. The paper argues these findings raise questions about the validity of interpretations derived from simplified models. However, simplified models are still useful tools. In what ways can simplified representations still provide value, despite their limitations? What precautions should we take?

9. This paper studies small-scale models, but how do you think the findings might change for large state-of-the-art models? For example, could overparameterization make models more robust to distribution shifts even after simplification?

10. You connect this work to similar challenges in neuroscience around developing interpretations that generalize across stimuli distributions. What parallels can we draw regarding best practices and future directions for developing robust interpretations?
