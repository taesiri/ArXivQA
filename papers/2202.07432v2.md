# [A precortical module for robust CNNs to light variations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07432v2)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to variations in lighting conditions by modeling the precortical stages of the mammalian visual system. 

Specifically, the authors hypothesize that adding a "precortical" module inspired by the retinal and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) portions of the visual pathway can help make CNNs more robust to changes in overall image brightness and contrast. This is motivated by the ability of biological vision to adapt to large variations in ambient light levels.

The key elements of the precortical module are:

- Convolutional layers inspired by center-surround receptive fields in the retina/LGN that perform local inhibition to enhance borders and decorrelate mean light intensity. 

- Tanh nonlinearities to mimic neural spiking thresholds.

- Multiple stacked layers to model the different neuronal layers (bipolar, ganglion, LGN).

The central hypothesis is that inserting this bio-inspired module before a standard CNN architecture like LeNet will improve robustness to lighting variations not seen during training. This is tested on image datasets with simulated changes in brightness and contrast.

So in summary, the main research question is whether adding a precortical model of early visual processing can make CNNs more robust to lighting variations through mechanisms like gain control and local decorrelation. The hypothesis is evaluated through experiments on simulated image datasets.
