# [Do Large Code Models Understand Programming Concepts? A Black-box   Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05980)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Do Large Code Models Understand Programming Concepts? A Black-box Approach":

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on coding tasks like code completion, but it is unclear why or to what extent they actually understand programming concepts.
- Programming concepts include control flow, data flow, data types, identifier naming. Understanding these is key for reliably automating coding tasks.  
- Existing benchmarks focus on end-task performance and do not reveal fine-grained understanding of programming concepts.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes CACP, a counterfactual analysis framework to evaluate LLMs' understanding of programming concepts. 
- CACP generates minimal input perturbations called "mutations" that alter specific concepts like control flow or data flow. 
- It then estimates the effect of these mutations on the model's output to quantify understanding.

Main Contributions:
- Defines formal requirements and challenges for generating valid and minimal counterfactual programs.
- Proposes 4 different mutations to evaluate understanding of control flow, data flow, identifier naming concepts.
- Applies CACP to code completion task using datasets like HumanEval and MBPP. 
- Evaluates 10 major LLMs like PaLM, Code Llama, shows gaps in understanding, like 20%+ drop in accuracy for some mutations.
- Open-sources counterfactual samples and toolkit to benchmark programming concept understanding.

In summary, the paper proposes a testing methodology using counterfactual analysis to provide fine-grained insights into deficiencies in large code models' understanding of key programming concepts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a counterfactual testing framework called CACP to evaluate large language models' understanding of programming concepts by generating minimal syntactic perturbations in code that isolate specific predicates and analyzing the impact on model performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing CACP, a counterfactual testing framework for evaluating large language models' understanding of programming concept predicates (PCPs). The key ideas are using minimal mutations to generate counterfactual code inputs that isolate specific PCPs, and measuring the mutation effect on the model's performance.

2) Applying CACP to the code completion task. This involves defining 4 types of mutations to evaluate PCPs related to control flow, data flow, variable names, and data types. It also involves extending existing datasets like HumanEval and MBPP to generate counterfactuals. 

3) Evaluating 10 popular large language models using CACP and the proposed mutations and benchmark datasets. The results show significant drops in performance on counterfactual inputs for certain PCPs, suggesting gaps in the models' understanding. The analysis also looks at how performance depends on model size, training data, etc.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the CACP framework and methodology for evaluating fine-grained programming concept understanding in large language models, demonstrating its application, and providing insights from an extensive evaluation study.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this work include:

- Counterfactual analysis: The paper proposes using counterfactual analysis to evaluate models' understanding of programming concepts. This involves generating minimal perturbations to programs that isolate specific concepts.

- Programming concept predicates (PCPs): These refer to properties related to control flow, data flow, data types, and identifier naming that the paper aims to evaluate understanding of.

- Mutations: The paper defines mutations as transformations that perturb programs to generate counterfactuals for specific PCPs. Examples include flipping if-else conditions, swapping independent statements, breaking def-use chains, and changing variable names.

- Average mutation effect (AME): This is a metric proposed to quantify the effect of mutations on model performance, indicating understanding of the associated PCP.

- Code completion: The paper focuses on applying the framework to evaluate models for the code completion task.

- Large language models (LLMs): The method is used to benchmark popular LLMs like PaLM, LLaMA, and Code LLaMA in terms of their understanding of programming concepts.

Some other potential keywords: black-box evaluation, program analysis, code generation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes "Counterfactual Analysis for Programming Concept Predicates (CACP)" to evaluate model understanding of programming concepts. Could you elaborate on why counterfactual analysis is well-suited for this task compared to other analysis techniques? 

2. The paper identifies four key programming concept predicates - control flow, data flow, data types, and identifier naming. What motivated the choice of these four predicates and what challenges did you face in designing mutations for some of the more complex predicates like control flow?

3. One of the requirements outlined for counterfactual perturbations is that they only change isolated concepts in the code. However, the paper notes that technically any perturbation affects an infinite set of predicates. Could you expand on what relaxations you made to the specificity requirement and how you ensured the minimality of your mutations?  

4. The paper computes the Average Mutation Effect to quantify the impact of the perturbations. What were some alternative metrics you considered and what led you to settle on this formulation? How does it connect to the common Average Treatment Effect used in counterfactual analysis?

5. For the code completion task, the paper uses unit test correctness as the attribution function to evaluate generations. What are some limitations of this approach? Can you discuss any other attribution functions you experimented with?

6. The results show variable name invariance and if-else flip mutations have the largest effects across models. What implications does this have for how models learn programming concepts? How can the training process be improved?

7. The paper limits the study to only Python programs. What considerations would be important if applying CACP to other programming languages like Java or C++? Would all four evaluated predicates generalize?

8. One of the future works suggests using CACP mutations for data augmentation. What are some unique challenges with using mutated programs for training compared to data augmentation in other domains like images?

9. The framework uses deterministic decoding for evaluation. How would the Average Mutation Effects differ if sampled stochastically as is common during deployment? Is deterministic decoding an accurate estimate?

10. The paper acknowledges that crafting semantic preserving perturbations currently requires manual effort. What are your thoughts on using learned program transformations that provably preserve semantics as a way to automate counterfactual generation?
