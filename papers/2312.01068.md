# [DPHMs: Diffusion Parametric Head Models for Depth-based Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01068)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "DPHMs: Diffusion Parametric Head Models for Depth-based Tracking":

Problem:
- Reconstructing and tracking detailed 3D human heads from commodity depth sensors (e.g. Kinect) is challenging due to the partial views and sensor noise. 
- Recent neural parametric head models like NPHMs can represent high-fidelity head geometry but struggle when fitting to such imperfect scan data, leading to unrealistic reconstructions.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Diffusion Parametric Head Models (DPHMs) by coupling NPHMs with diffusion models to learn strong geometry priors.
- Disentangle the latent space into identity and expression. Learn their distributions separately using diffusion models.
- The diffusion models estimate the gradient of the identity/expression probability distribution. This acts as a regularizer when optimizing the latents to fit the depth data.  
- Effectively constrains the identity and expression codes to lie on the underlying manifold of plausible heads, avoiding implausible geometries.

Contributions:
- First diffusion generative model for robust head reconstruction and tracking from commodity depth sensors
- Novel regularization based on diffusion priors to constrain identity and expression latents during fitting
- Collected new dataset of Kinect facial expression sequences for evaluation
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in identity reconstruction, expression tracking and robustness to noise/sparsity

In summary, the paper introduces a novel approach to integrate diffusion models with neural head avatars, leveraging the learned priors for robust head reconstruction and tracking from imperfect single-view depth data. The diffusion-based regularizers are key to avoiding implausible head shapes. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority over previous state-of-the-art.
