# [PreFLMR: Scaling Up Fine-Grained Late-Interaction Multi-modal Retrievers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08327)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large multimodal models (LMMs) excel at natural language and visual understanding but struggle with demanding tasks like knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA). KB-VQA requires retrieving relevant information from documents to shape accurate answers. Recent retrieval methods like fine-grained late-interaction multi-modal retrieval (FLMR) outperform prior approaches but lack pre-training to fully leverage large models.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors introduce M2KR, a benchmark with 9 datasets covering image-text, question-text and image-question-text retrieval. M2KR is used to develop PreFLMR, a pre-trained version of FLMR. PreFLMR encodes images with ViT encoders and text with BERT encoders. The outputs are projected to a common space through a mapping structure to compute relevance via late interaction. 

PreFLMR is pre-trained in 4 stages: (1) text-encoder pre-training; (2) mapping structure training; (3) intermediate KB-VQA pretraining on E-VQA; (4) full-scale multi-task finetuning on M2KR. This improves generalization across tasks. Finetuned PreFLMR powers state-of-the-art performance on retrieval augmentation for KB-VQA models.

Contributions:
(1) M2KR benchmark suite with 9 diverse datasets for training and evaluating general-purpose multi-modal retrievers.
(2) PreFLMR, a strong pre-trained multi-modal retriever using M2KR. It achieves new SOTA results on 7 out of 9 M2KR tasks. 
(3) Studies on the scaling behavior of FLMR w.r.t model sizes and training data to guide future multi-modal retriever development.
(4) Demonstrates that PreFLMR can further boost performance on challenging KB-VQA datasets via retrieval augmentation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents PreFLMR, a scaled-up pre-trained multi-modal retriever that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of vision-language retrieval tasks by leveraging larger vision encoders, intermediate task-specific pre-training, and the M2KR benchmark for multi-task evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The M2KR task suite encompassing nine datasets and three types of retrieval tasks for training and evaluating general-purpose multi-modal knowledge retrievers. The authors create M2KR by re-purposing various vision and language data sets into a unified benchmark for assessing multi-task multi-modal retrieval.

2. PreFLMR, a strong multi-modal retriever pre-trained on a vision-language corpus of over ten million items. The authors show that PreFLMR performs well across a range of knowledge retrieval tasks when given appropriate instructions. 

3. A study of the scaling behaviour of FLMR (Fine-grained Late-interaction Multi-modal Retriever) in terms of its model parameters and training data. This is presented as the first systematic study of scaling in late-interaction based vision-language retrievers, intended to provide empirical guidance for future work.

In summary, the main contribution is the M2KR benchmark, the PreFLMR model, and the analysis of scaling properties of late-interaction retrieval systems like FLMR.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Fine-grained Late-interaction Multi-modal Retrieval (FLMR)
- Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) 
- Multi-task Multi-modal Knowledge Retrieval (M2KR) benchmark
- Pre-trained FLMR (PreFLMR)
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Scaling behavior of vision-language retrieval models
- Vision encoders (e.g. ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H, ViT-G)
- Text encoders (e.g. BERT-Small, BERT-Medium, BERT-Base, BERT-Large)
- Intermediate pre-training
- Multi-modal late interaction
- Instruction tuning
- Task conditioning

The key focus areas are developing PreFLMR as a strong general-purpose multi-modal retriever using the M2KR benchmark, and studying scaling behaviors of vision-language retrieval systems like the impact of model size, pre-training strategies, and task diversity. Downstream application is in knowledge-intensive KB-VQA tasks using retrieval-augmented LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new multi-task multi-modal knowledge retrieval benchmark called M2KR. What are the key differences between M2KR and existing benchmarks in this area? How does constructing M2KR by repurposing 9 vision and language datasets ensure rich and diverse training data?

2. The paper introduces the PreFLMR model architecture. How does the visual feature extraction in PreFLMR differ from the original FLMR model? Explain the rationale behind using both [CLS] tokens and patch embeddings from ViT encoders. 

3. The paper conducts a 4-stage progressive training procedure for PreFLMR. Walk through each training stage and explain what components get updated in each one. Why is intermediate pretraining focused specifically on the E-VQA dataset beneficial?

4. What are the key findings from the analyses on how scaling different components of PreFLMR (vision encoders, text encoders, mapping structures) impacts overall performance? Are there any surprising or counterintuitive results?

5. The paper shows strong performance gains from using PreFLMR for retrieval augmented VQA tasks like OKVQA, InfoSeek and E-VQA. Compare example questions from OKVQA and E-VQA - why does retrieval have less impact for OKVQA?  

6. Explain the motivation behind adjusting relative proportions of training datasets used in Stage 3 of PreFLMR training. How does this help achieve more consistent multi-task learning?

7. Analyze the tradeoffs between optimization constraints used in defining the mutual information metric $I_{V}[N_f](D_1 \rightarrow D_2)$ for quantifying gains from intermediate pretraining.

8. Whatbest practices and insights does the paper provide regarding scaling of vision-language retrieval systems? How could these inform future work?

9. Discuss any limitations of the experimental and analysis methodologies used in this work. What further investigations would you suggest as worthwhile future extensions?

10. The paper makes PreFLMR and M2KR benchmark available for non-commercial use. Brainstorm some potential real-world applications that could benefit from such models and data. What ethical considerations need to be addressed?
