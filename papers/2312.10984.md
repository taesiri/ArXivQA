# [Predicting Financial Literacy via Semi-supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10984)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Financial literacy (FL) is important for making sound financial decisions, but measuring and predicting individual FL levels is challenging. 
- Doing FL surveys with millions of customers is time-consuming and expensive. 
- Most prior FL prediction studies use only labeled survey data, failing to exploit abundant unlabeled customer financial data.

Proposed Solution:
- Use semi-supervised regression (SSR) to predict continuous FL scores by combining a small labeled dataset with a large unlabeled dataset.
- Apply synthetic minority oversampling (SMOGN) to handle the class imbalance in the unlabeled data.  
- Use a nonparametric co-regression algorithm (COREG) to iteratively label confident unlabeled points and retrain the regressors.

Key Contributions:
- Propose SMOGN-COREG, a new SSR model that combines SMOGN undersampling and oversampling with the COREG co-regression algorithm.
- Test on 5 real-world financial datasets, with ~5% points labeled and ~95% unlabeled. 
- Outperforms supervised regressors and a baseline SSR model in RMSE, R-squared, MAE and PCC metrics.
- Demonstrates the value of SSR for exploiting unlabeled financial data to predict continuous FL outcomes more accurately than labeled data alone.
- Provides a step towards better targeted marketing and interventions to improve consumer financial wellbeing.

In summary, the key innovation is showing SSR with careful sampling and modeling techniques can boost FL prediction accuracy over fully supervised approaches by exploiting readily available unlabeled financial data.
