# [Patterns of Persistence and Diffusibility across World's Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01698)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Similarities between languages can be caused by genetic inheritance, language contact/diffusion, universals or chance. Colexficiations (when a single word conveys multiple meanings) are underexplored in terms of what governs cross-lingual similarity patterns.
- Prior work lacked large-scale analysis and relied on binary modeling of colexification patterns from an external database without context.

Proposed Solution:
- Construct large-scale graphs with semantic, phonological, genealogical and geographical data for 1966 languages. 
- Test established linguistic hypotheses about persistence (stability over time) and diffusibility (susceptibility to diffusion) of colexifications vs phonology.
- Propose and test new hypotheses about differential persistence/diffusibility based on concept concreteness and affect. 

Contributions:
- Strongly support a hypothesis that phonology is more persistent than colexifications. 
- Contradict a hypothesis that colexifications are more diffusible.
- Show colexifications for abstract and affective concepts are slightly more persistent.
- Release large multimodal graph resource for future linguistic and NLP research.

The key insight is that both colexification and phonological similarities predominantly reflect genealogical relatedness rather than geographic proximity/contact. This largescale graph analysis advances our understanding of what governs cross-lingual lexical patterns.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper constructs large-scale language graphs incorporating semantic, genealogical, phonological and geographical data for 1,966 languages, tests established hypotheses from linguistics on language change, proposes new hypotheses, and discusses applications in multilingual NLP and comparative linguistics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is:

1) The construction of large-scale language graphs incorporating semantic, genealogical, phonological, and geographical data for overall 1966 languages and 1,931,595 language pairs. This resource allows the exploration of several established hypotheses from previous linguistic research while proposing new ones.

2) Testing and providing evidence for/against the following hypotheses:

- H1: Hypothesis of (a) low persistence (genealogical stability) and (b) high diffusibility (susceptibility to diffusion through language contact) of colexification patterns compared to phonological patterns. The results strongly support H1a but contradict H1b. 

- H2a: Hypothesis of differential persistence and diffusibility of colexification patterns involving concepts with differing degrees of genealogical stability. The results contradict this hypothesis.

- New hypothesis H2b on differential persistence and diffusibility of abstract vs concrete colexification patterns. The results show some support for higher persistence but not diffusibility of abstract patterns.

- New hypothesis H2c on differential persistence and diffusibility of affectively loaded abstract vs concrete colexification patterns. Results show stronger differences in diffusibility than persistence between these concepts.

In summary, the paper contributes a valuable new resource for interdisciplinary research and uses it to test several linguistic hypotheses, verifying some while disproving others and proposing new ones. The analyses showcase the potential of this resource.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Colexification patterns - The use of a single lexical form to convey multiple, related meanings. The paper analyzes cross-linguistic similarities in colexification patterns.

- Persistence - The genealogical stability of linguistic features over time. The paper examines the persistence of colexification patterns versus phonological patterns across languages. 

- Diffusibility - The susceptibility of linguistic features to diffusion through language contact. The paper investigates the diffusibility of colexification patterns.

- Language graph - A graph representation incorporating semantic, genealogical, phonological and geographical data for languages. The paper constructs large-scale language graphs for analysis. 

- Hypotheses - Specific hypotheses from linguistics literature that the paper tests related to persistence and diffusibility of colexification patterns.

- Phonological distances - Distances between languages based on phonological forms of concepts. Compared to colexification pattern distances.

- Differential persistence and diffusibility - How persistence and diffusibility may differ based on types of concepts (e.g. abstract vs concrete concepts).

So in summary - colexification patterns, persistence, diffusibility, language graphs, hypotheses testing, phonological distances, differential persistence/diffusibility are key terms associated with this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper constructs language graphs incorporating semantic, phonological, genealogical, and geographical data. What were the key data sources used for each type of data and what preprocessing steps were taken before constructing the graphs? 

2. The paper uses distributional semantics based on Bible translation data to model colexification patterns instead of the binary representation used in previous work. What is the justification for using frequencies instead of binary values? How might this impact or bias the downstream analysis?

3. The paper tests several hypotheses related to persistence and diffusibility of colexifications versus phonological forms. What statistical analyses were conducted to test these hypotheses and what were the key results? Were there any surprising or contradictory findings compared to previous linguistic work?

4. The paper proposes hypotheses regarding differential persistence and diffusibility based on concreteness and affectiveness. What specific concept vocabularies were constructed and what analyses were used to test these original hypotheses? 

5. The language contact intensity measure uses number of intervening languages based on geographical proximity. How was this operationalized and what are its limitations compared to other possible operationalizations?  

6. What data distributions were analyzed regarding phonological versus colexification distances across different levels of language relatedness? Did this analysis reveal anything notable about the behavior of these distances?

7. The paper finds mostly negligible differences in diffusibility between phonology, syntax, and colexifications. What factors may explain the lack of clear differentiation found on diffusibility compared to persistence?

8. What analysis was done using adjusted rand indices to compare colexification patterns involving different concept vocabularies across major language families? Did this surface any additional insights?

9. The paper identifies some cases where colexification distances correlate negatively with geographic/contact distances for closely related languages. What hypotheses might explain these inverse relationships in branches like Boko-Busa and Tepehua? 

10. What are some key limitations of the constructed language graphs and the analyses performed that could be addressed in future work? What impacts might translated bible data and other biases have?
