# [Enhancing Visual Document Understanding with Contrastive Learning in   Large Visual-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19014)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large visual-language models (LVLMs) have shown promise in multimodal understanding tasks, but their performance on visual document understanding (VDU) tasks in text-rich scenarios is still limited. 
- This is due to the lack of exploration of fine-grained visual features within LVLMs, referred to as the "fine-grained feature collapse" issue. Capturing fine-grained details is crucial for understanding documents.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel framework called "Document Object Contrastive learning" (DoCo) to enhance visual representations for VDU tasks.  
- DoCo introduces a contrastive learning approach that leverages a multimodal encoder to obtain layout, text and visual features of document objects. These are aligned with the visual features from the LVLM's image encoder.
- This contrastive discrimination of document objects enables the image encoder to acquire more fine-grained cues to better understand text-rich documents.

Key Contributions:
- Identifies the "fine-grained feature collapse" issue in LVLMs for VDU tasks.
- Proposes the DoCo framework to align multimodal document object features with visual features via contrastive learning. 
- DoCo is a plug-and-play module that can enhance visual representations in various LVLMs without increasing inference complexity.
- Experiments show DoCo consistently improves performance of LVLMs on multiple VDU benchmarks, mitigating the gap with generic vision-language tasks.

In summary, the key idea is that contrasting multimodal document object features with visual features enables LVLMs to better capture fine-grained details crucial for understanding text-rich documents. The proposed DoCo framework implements this effectively.
