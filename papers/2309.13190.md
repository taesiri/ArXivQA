# [Spatial-frequency channels, shape bias, and adversarial robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13190)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

From my reading, this paper seems to address two main research questions:1) What spatial frequency information do humans and neural networks use to recognize objects in natural images? 2) How do the spatial frequency channels used by humans and neural networks for object recognition compare, and how might their differences relate to other observed differences in behavior like shape bias and adversarial robustness?To investigate these questions, the authors adapt the "critical band masking" paradigm from auditory psychophysics to the visual domain. By measuring how object recognition performance in humans and neural networks is affected by adding narrowband noise at different spatial frequencies, they are able to characterize the spatial frequency tuning and reveal the frequency channel used for object recognition. The key findings from this analysis are:- Humans use a surprisingly narrow 1-octave wide channel for recognizing objects, consistent with what has been found previously for letter recognition. This suggests a canonical frequency channel for human object recognition.- In contrast, neural networks use a much wider channel, around 2-4 times broader than the human channel. This means networks are affected by noise at frequencies that don't impact human recognition. - Properties of the network frequency channel, like bandwidth and peak sensitivity, correlate with shape bias and adversarial robustness. This suggests differences in frequency tuning could underlie differences in these behaviors between humans and neural networks.- Adversarial training improves robustness but actually widens the channel further from the human bandwidth.So in summary, the paper introduces critical band masking to systematically compare human and network visual recognition, revealing important differences in frequency tuning that relate to shape bias and adversarial robustness. The authors suggest narrowing the machine critical band could improve network robustness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the key contributions appear to be:1. Introducing critical band masking as a task for comparing object recognition in neural networks and humans. The authors test 14 humans and 76 neural networks on 16-way ImageNet categorization in the presence of narrowband noise to characterize their spatial frequency channels.2. Finding that humans recognize objects in natural images using the same narrow one-octave-wide channel they use for letters and gratings. This makes it a canonical feature of human object recognition. 3. In contrast, the neural network channel is 2-4 times wider than the human channel across various architectures and training strategies. Networks are more affected by noise at high/low frequencies that don't impact humans.4. Demonstrating that properties of the network spatial frequency channel (bandwidth, center frequency, peak noise sensitivity) correlate strongly with shape bias (53% variance explained) and robustness of adversarially trained networks (74% variance explained).5. Showing that adversarial training improves robustness but expands the already-wider-than-human network channel even further. This suggests efforts to improve network robustness should look to narrow the critical band.In summary, the key contributions are using critical band masking to reveal differences between human and network spatial frequency tuning, and relating this to shape bias, adversarial robustness, and effects of adversarial training. The authors introduce critical band masking for model-human comparison and highlight that matching the human critical band may be important for improving neural networks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper introduces critical band masking to compare spatial frequency tuning of object recognition in humans versus neural networks, finding that networks rely on a much wider range of frequencies and that properties of the network channel correlate with shape bias and adversarial robustness.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on spatial frequency channels and object recognition:- It introduces critical band masking, a classic paradigm from auditory psychophysics, as a new method for studying spatial frequency tuning in visual object recognition. This allows systematic measurement of the spatial frequency channel used by both humans and neural networks. Prior work has studied SF tuning more indirectly, e.g. by filtering images.- The finding that humans rely on a narrow 1-octave channel for object recognition echoes classic results on letter recognition, but is more surprising given the diversity of object sizes/scales. This suggests the 1-octave channel is really fundamental to human vision. - In contrast, the paper shows neural nets have much wider tuning, spanning 2-4 octaves. This divergence from human SF tuning has not been directly demonstrated before. Prior work identified differences in reliance on low vs high SFs.- Relating the SF channel properties to shape bias and adversarial robustness (R^2 ~ 50-75%) provides a new perspective on these well-known human/network differences. The correlations suggest origins in the different frequency tuning.- Previous work has related adversarial robustness to reliance on high vs low SFs. But the channel bandwidth correlation is a new insight. The paper suggests adversarial training actually widens tuning, diverging further from human vision.- Overall, the introduction of critical band masking, the human/network comparison results, and linking SF tuning to shape bias and adversarial robustness offer new insights into an important aspect of object recognition. The frequency channel viewpoint provides a unifying perspective on several major topics in this field.In summary, the paper makes both methodological and empirical contributions that significantly advance our fundamental understanding of the role of spatial frequencies in object recognition by biological and artificial vision systems. The critical band masking method and human/network comparisons are novel, while the connections made to shape bias and adversarial robustness are new perspectives on well-studied topics.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Further exploring the effects of different kinds of training data and data augmentations on the spatial frequency channels used by neural networks. The current results are based on a representative sample of network architectures and training procedures, but more work is needed to systematically study the impact of training data.- Conducting additional experiments to determine if the relationship between channel properties and robustness/shape bias is causal rather than just correlational. The authors suggest experiments like training models with different spatial frequency channels to directly test the effects.- Comparing the critical band masking approach of adding filtered noise versus directly filtering the images themselves to remove certain frequencies. The authors mention that these two methods yield different results in human studies, so it would be interesting to also compare their effects in neural networks.- Studying whether the channels used for small vs large objects differ. The current analysis looks at channel properties averaged across object sizes, but size-dependent channels could provide more insight. - Examining if channels vary across object categories. The current results pool data across categories, but category-specific channels may reveal interesting differences.- Using the normalized threshold approach to derive channels for networks and humans that have very low overall noise sensitivity/efficiency. This could expand the range of models that can be analyzed.- Investigating where in the network architecture the global channel emerges from. Since neural networks are complex nonlinear systems, it could be insightful to understand how the channel arises from component computations.So in summary, the authors propose several directions to further explore the spatial frequency channels of networks, their relationship to robustness, and how they compare to human vision through extensions of the critical band masking methodology.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces critical band masking as a task for comparing object recognition in humans and neural networks. The authors test 14 humans and 76 neural networks on 16-way ImageNet categorization in the presence of narrowband noise. They find that humans recognize objects using a narrow one-octave spatial frequency channel, consistent with past work on letter and grating recognition. In contrast, neural networks use a channel 2-4 times wider than humans, making them susceptible to noise humans ignore. Network channel properties correlate with shape bias (53% variance explained) and adversarial robustness (74% explained for adversarial networks), suggesting these behavioral differences may relate to channel differences. However, adversarially robust networks have even wider channels, increasing the human-network discrepancy. Overall, the paper demonstrates large differences between human and network spatial frequency tuning, and that adversarial training expands network channels further from the human channel. The authors propose critical band masking as a useful model-human comparison tool.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces critical band masking as a task for comparing spatial frequency tuning in neural networks and human vision. The authors tested 14 human observers and 76 neural networks on a 16-way ImageNet categorization task with images masked by narrowband noise at different spatial frequencies. They find that humans recognize objects using a narrow one-octave channel, consistent with past work on letter recognition. In contrast, neural networks use a much wider channel, around 2-4 times the bandwidth of humans. The paper shows that properties of the network spatial frequency channel (bandwidth, center frequency, peak noise sensitivity) correlate strongly with shape bias and adversarial robustness. Networks with wider channels and higher peak sensitivity are more susceptible to adversarial attacks but more biased towards texture over shape. Surprisingly, adversarial training expands the already-too-wide network channel even further from the human channel. In summary, this work introduces critical band masking to compare spatial tuning in human and machine vision. It reveals a large divergence between human and neural network object recognition channels. Network reliance on wider frequency bands provides a spatial frequency-based explanation for differences in shape bias and adversarial robustness. The results suggest that efforts to improve network robustness should aim to narrow the critical band closer to the canonical human channel.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper introduces critical band masking to study the spatial frequency channels used by humans and neural networks for object recognition. The authors test 14 human observers and 76 neural networks on a 16-way ImageNet categorization task in the presence of narrowband Gaussian noise added to images. The noise is filtered to be within 1-octave wide spatial frequency bands centered at different frequencies. By measuring categorization accuracy thresholds for each spatial frequency band, the authors are able to characterize and compare the spatial frequency tuning or "channel" used by humans and networks for object recognition. Fitting Gaussian functions to the noise sensitivity curves reveals key properties of the channel, including bandwidth, peak frequency, and peak noise sensitivity. This allows the authors to quantify how neural network channels differ from the canonical human channel, and relate channel properties to shape bias and adversarial robustness. The critical band masking paradigm provides a principled way to analyze the spatial frequency tuning relevant for object recognition.
