# [Span-Oriented Information Extraction -- A Unifying Perspective on   Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15453)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- There is a lot of heterogeneity among information extraction tasks like named entity recognition, entity linking, relation extraction etc. This makes progress in this area challenging. 
- There needs to be a unified perspective to view these tasks as variants of the same underlying problem.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a span-oriented view of information extraction where the goal is to extract spans from text and assign labels to them. 
- A span is defined as a triple (b, e, c) comprising the start token index, end token index in the text, and the class label.
- Various information extraction tasks like NER, entity linking etc. can be viewed as extracting spans and assigning appropriate labels.

- The tasks are categorized based on the transformations they apply:
    - Sequential labeling: Label each token in BIO format
    - Token prototyping: Cluster token embeddings  
    - Token pair classification: Classify relationship between token pairs
    - Span classification: Classify extracted spans 
    - Span locating: Find start and end token given class label
    - Span generation: Generate output text with labeled spans

- Evaluation metrics and tradeoffs of different transformations are analyzed.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a unified span-oriented view of information extraction that enables easier comparability between different tasks.  
- Systematically categorizes information extraction systems by the transformations they apply to create labeled spans.
- Analyzes tradeoffs, advantages and limitations of different modeling choices.
- Lays the groundwork to develop more universal information extraction systems and better transfer learning.
