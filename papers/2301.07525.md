## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Develop more robust point cloud perception models that can handle both out-of-distribution (OOD) styles and OOD corruptions. The authors show that current methods are still limited in handling both of these robustness challenges together.

- Pursue more generalizable and robust novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction methods by leveraging the large-scale OmniObject3D dataset. The diversity of shapes and textures in this dataset provides an opportunity to learn stronger priors.

- Study strategies to deal with the enlarged semantic bias observed during 3D object generation on the OmniObject3D dataset. The authors suggest analyzing how cross-class relationships affect generation distribution as an important factor.

- Improve disentanglement between geometry and texture during 3D object generation. The results indicate these factors are still entangled, leading to texture being affected by geometry changes.

- Develop more robust and generalizable methods for novel view synthesis from casually captured videos, which introduce further challenges compared to rendered images.

- Explore robust strategies for utilizing estimated geometry cues (e.g. depth maps) to assist sparse-view surface reconstruction. The accuracy of these cues varies across different scenarios.

- Study surface reconstruction with a naturally unaligned coordinate system rather than a predefined canonical space, which impairs learned priors.

In general, the authors highlight opportunities to develop techniques that are more robust and generalizable by utilizing the large-scale, diverse OmniObject3D dataset across various 3D vision tasks.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper introduces OmniObject3D, a large-scale 3D object dataset containing 6,000 high-quality textured meshes of real-world objects scanned by professional devices. The dataset has 190 daily categories sharing common classes with popular 2D datasets like ImageNet and LVIS. Each object is captured by both 2D and 3D sensors, providing textured meshes, point clouds, multi-view rendered images, and real-captured videos. Leveraging the high-quality scans and diverse objects, the authors carefully design four benchmarks: robust 3D perception to study point cloud robustness against out-of-distribution styles and corruptions; novel-view synthesis and neural surface reconstruction to explore scene-specific and generalizable algorithms; and 3D object generation to examine state-of-the-art generative models on large vocabulary and realistic data.
