# [OmniObject3D: Large-Vocabulary 3D Object Dataset for Realistic   Perception, Reconstruction and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07525)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to create a large-vocabulary 3D object dataset with high-quality, real-world scans to support research in realistic 3D vision tasks like perception, novel view synthesis, surface reconstruction, and generation. The key contributions and hypotheses are:- They hypothesize that a large-scale, real-world 3D object dataset is needed to support advances in realistic computer vision research, as most existing datasets rely on synthetic data. - They create the OmniObject3D dataset with 6,000 high-quality textured meshes of real objects in 190 categories, along with other rich annotations like rendered images and point clouds. This is hypothesized to be a more realistic and comprehensive dataset compared to others.- They hypothesize this dataset can support research in several tracks like robust 3D perception, novel view synthesis, neural surface reconstruction, and 3D object generation. They design benchmarks and experiments to test state-of-the-art methods in these areas using their new dataset.- Their experiments reveal new challenges and opportunities unique to using large-scale, real-world 3D data, such as issues with robustness and generalization that are not exposed by synthetic datasets. This supports their hypothesis that advances in realistic 3D vision require datasets like theirs.In summary, the main research question is how to create a more realistic, large-vocabulary 3D dataset to support research in key 3D vision tasks, which they address through the construction and benchmarking of OmniObject3D. Their experiments support the hypothesis that this dataset exposes new research directions not visible with synthetic data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Introducing OmniObject3D, a large-scale 3D object dataset containing 6,000 high-quality textured meshes scanned from real-world objects across 190 daily categories. It is currently the largest real-world 3D object dataset with accurate 3D meshes. - Providing rich annotations for the objects, including textured meshes, multi-view images rendered in Blender, real video frames, point clouds, etc. This supports research in various tasks like 3D perception, novel view synthesis, surface reconstruction, and 3D generation.- Setting up four evaluation tracks on the dataset - robust 3D perception, novel view synthesis, neural surface reconstruction, and 3D object generation. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark state-of-the-art methods in these areas.- The robust 3D perception experiments reveal limitations of previous benchmarks and shed light on evaluating robustness to both OOD styles and corruptions.- The novel view synthesis experiments provide a large-scale benchmark for both single-scene and cross-scene settings. The results demonstrate opportunities for more generalizable novel view synthesis.- The surface reconstruction experiments cover both dense-view and sparse-view settings. The results indicate challenges in dealing with difficult geometry and utilizing estimated cues. - The 3D generation experiments reveal problems like distribution bias when training generative models on a large-vocabulary realistic dataset.In summary, the main contribution is introducing a large-scale, richly annotated, and realistic 3D object dataset to facilitate research in multiple 3D vision tasks, as well as providing extensive experiments and analysis that reveal new challenges and opportunities in these tasks.
